# Campaign results — the conjecture machine's first runs

*Lab-notebook record (2026-06-10). Same honesty rules as `echoes/`: failures are
recorded, fixes are bought by measured failures, null results are results.*

## TL;DR

The full loop — **PROPOSE** (genetic programming, exact-rational expression
trees) → **REDUCE** (SymPy, ansatz → ODE residuals) → **VERIFY** (numeric
spot-check → symbolic proof) → **NOVELTY** (invariant-curve fingerprint) →
**EVOLVE** — works end to end. Six rungs across the dimensional ladder,
**80.5 s total**, all verdicts correct:

| Rung | Found f(r) | Verify | Novelty verdict | Gen | Time |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A. 3+1, Λ=0 | `(r + 9/4)/r` | ✅ theorem | KNOWN: Schwarzschild, M̂=−1.125 | 2 | 2.8 s |
| B. 2+1, Λ=−1 | `r² + 3/40` | ✅ theorem | BLIND_SPOT (CSI) — see below | 0 | 0.5 s |
| C. 4+1, Λ=0 | `1 + 4/(3r²)` | ✅ theorem | KNOWN: Tangherlini, μ̂=−4/3 | 2 | 3.0 s |
| D. 3+1, Λ=3/4 | `1 + 1/r − r²/4` | ✅ theorem | KNOWN: Schwarzschild–de Sitter, M̂=−0.5 | 23 | 28.6 s |
| E. 5+1, Λ=0 | `1 − 375/(32r³)` | ✅ theorem | **CANDIDATE_NEW** → escalate | 5 | 11.8 s |
| F. 4+1, Λ=−1 | `r²/6 + 1 − 2/(3r²)` | ✅ theorem | **CANDIDATE_NEW** → escalate | 51 | 33.9 s |

Rungs A–D are the injection test: the machine, never told any solution,
re-derived GR's greatest hits from random expression trees and recognized them.
Rungs E–F were aimed deliberately **outside the fingerprint catalog**, and the
machine did exactly the right thing: verified the solutions to theorem level,
found no catalog match, and escalated to the human.

**Honesty box:** E is the 6D Schwarzschild–Tangherlini black hole (μ = 375/32)
and F is the 5D Tangherlini–AdS black hole (μ = 2/3, ℓ² = 6) — both *known to
the literature*, both new to the machine's catalog. What was demonstrated is the
**discovery pathway**, not a new theorem about nature. Aiming at genuinely
unmined ansatz families (two-function metrics, rotating rational forms,
modified-gravity field equations) is the next phase, and it runs on exactly
this machinery.

---

## What the machine found that we didn't ask for

**1. It discovered flat space, then the de Sitter ground state — the same
lesson twice.** In campaign v1, rung A's generation-0 "discovery" was `f ≡ 1`
(Minkowski: solves vacuum perfectly, discovers nothing), and rung D's was
`f = 1 − r²/4` (pure de Sitter — the vacuum ground state of that Λ, same
laziness one level up). The general fix: the maximally-symmetric member of
every (n, Λ) family is `f = 1 − 2Λr²/((n−1)(n−2))`, computable in advance;
fitness now penalizes candidates sitting on it, and promotion rejects
constant-invariant hits when hunting mass. *A verifier defines what counts as
a solution; only a novelty layer defines what counts as a discovery.*

**2. The equations don't share our taste in mass.** On every unconstrained
rung the GP's first exact hit had **negative mass** (`f = 1 + 9/(4r)` etc.) —
naked-singularity branches, exact vacuum all the same. Plausible reason (flagged
as hypothesis, not measured): negative-mass f has no horizon zero near the
sample radii, so the fitness landscape is smoother there. The fingerprint
matches the signed branch and reports it (M̂ = −1.125, μ̂ = −4/3, M̂ = −0.5).
Interestingly, on the two uncatalogued rungs the machine delivered
**positive-mass black holes** — E and F have genuine horizons.

**3. The 2+1 rung graded its own ladder.** Rung B's verdict is permanently
BLIND_SPOT, and that is *correct physics*, not a tool limitation you can fix:
2+1 gravity has no local degrees of freedom, every Λ<0 vacuum is locally AdS₃,
and BTZ differs from `f = r² + 3/40` only **globally** (quotient
identification — a black hole made of topology). No local invariant can ever
tell them apart. The dimensional ladder's "⚠️ degenerate" verdict for Flatland
gravity, rediscovered by a machine in 0.5 seconds.

## Fixes bought by measured failures (campaign v1 → v2)

| Failure (measured) | Fix |
|---|---|
| Kerr blanket-simplify ran >12 CPU-min, never finished | Verify the **Ricci form** `R_ab = 2Λ/(n−2)·g_ab` (equivalent for n>2, much smaller) |
| Kerr in Boyer–Lindquist: 500 s → UNPROVEN (sin 6θ swamps; numerically vacuum to 10⁻¹³²) | **u = cos θ** substitution → all components rational → zero-testing decidable → **VERIFIED in 9 s** |
| Loop "discovered" Minkowski, then pure de Sitter | Vacuum-ground-state penalty + CSI rejection at promotion (except 2+1, where CSI is the result) |
| Fingerprint missed Schwarzschild-in-PG-coordinates | nsolve absolute tolerance vs ~10⁻⁸ invariant values → **ratio-form equations** + explicit tol |
| Fingerprint missed the negative-μ Tangherlini branch | Hand-picked Newton starts → **data-driven starts** (signed log-grid over the parameter; 1D bisection onto the K-surface) |
| Fingerprint missed SdS: at sampled radii the mass term is a 10⁻⁵ ripple on the Λ floor of K | **Variation-aware sampling** — sample the invariant curve where it varies, deterministically |
| One GP seed stagnated 140 generations (2200 s) at residual 6.8×10⁻⁴ | **Stagnation cutoff** (30 flat generations → restart with fresh seed); campaign time 2300 s → 80 s |

Every one of these is now a regression test: `01_verifier.py --kerr`,
`02_fingerprints.py`, `03_rediscover.py`, `04_campaign.py` all end with an
ALL-EXPECTATIONS-MET / PASSED gate, in both directions (knowns must pass,
sabotage must fail, costumes must be unmasked, blind spots must be declared).

---

## Where this leaves the risk profile

- The static one-function ansatz is now **strip-mined by us too** — within it,
  the machine finds everything that exists in minutes. This was the point: the
  ansatz was the training ground, not the target.
- The machinery that survives contact with harder targets: the three-valued
  verifier (rational-coordinates rule), the fingerprint filter with declared
  blind spots, the triviality ladder (flat → ground-state → known), the
  stagnation-restart evolutionary harness.
- Next targets, in order of reach: **two-function ansatz** `−f(r)dt² +
  dr²/h(r) + r²dΩ²` (where f≠h lives e.g. interior solutions and many modified-
  gravity black holes); **stationary rational forms** (the Kerr lesson says
  off-diagonal is fine if rational); **catalog growth** (every confirmed find
  gets generalized to a symbolic family and added — the catalog is the
  machine's memory); **modified-gravity REDUCE** (the EdGB metric, known only
  numerically since 1996, as the marquee genre-(c) target).

# v2 (2026-06-11): memory + the bigger hall

v1's two declared caveats — no memory, one-function room — are closed.

## 05 — catalog auto-growth (the machine's memory)

`05_generalize.py` takes a confirmed find and tests each numeric constant
against the full symbolic verifier: replace it with a symbol, re-prove. The
machine sorted hair from law autonomously:

| v1 find | constant | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `1 − (375/32)/r³` (6D) | `1` | structural — fixed by field equations |
| | `375/32` | **free** → family `1 − c₁/r³`, proved for all c₁ |
| `r²/6 + 1 − (2/3)/r²` (5D AdS) | `1/6` | structural — it IS the Λ=−1 coefficient |
| | `1` | structural |
| | `2/3` | **free** → family `r²/6 + 1 − c₁/r²` |

Families are theorems (verified with the parameter symbolic), persisted to
`catalog_discoveries.json`, loaded by every future `build_catalog()` call.
Memory test: both original numeric finds re-classify as KNOWN_LIKELY with the
correct parameter recovered (c₁ ≈ −11.7187 = −375/32; c₁ ≈ −2/3). The 04
campaign deliberately runs memoryless (`include_discoveries=False`) as the
frozen v1 regression.

## 06 — the two-function hall (Birkhoff stress test)

Ansatz `−f(r)dt² + dr²/h(r) + r²dΩ²`, f and h independent genomes — v1's
search space, squared. Birkhoff's theorem says static spherical vacuum holds
nothing beyond the known families (f can differ from h only by constant
time-rescaling), so the correct output is **zero false novelty**. Result —
all three rungs, exactly that:

| Rung | Found | Gauge check | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3+1, Λ=0 | `f = h = (r+5/4)/r` | f/h = 1 | KNOWN: Schwarzschild, M̂=−0.625 |
| 4+1, Λ=−1 | `f = h = r²/6 + 1 + 8/(9r²)` | f/h = 1 | KNOWN: **the machine's own grown family**, c₁≈8/9 |
| 2+1, Λ=−1 | `f = h = r² + 7` | f/h = 1 | BLIND_SPOT (CSI) — correct, forever |

The memory rung is the closed loop in one line: *discover (04) → generalize
(05) → remember (json) → recognize (06).* In smoke runs the machine also
produced `f = (4/105)r², h = r²` — exploiting the time-rescaling gauge freedom
on its own.

## v2 fixes bought by measured failures

| Failure (measured) | Fix |
|---|---|
| 2D Newton stalled at ~1e-6 from every start on steep invariant curves (G1 ∝ p⁴(p+r³)/r²⁵) — the grown 6D family was unmatchable | **No Newton.** Nested 1D bisection: solve the K-equation for the coordinate at each trial parameter, bisect the parameter on the G1-mismatch sign change |
| Per-slot crossover stagnated at residual ~1–3 on every 3+1/4+1 two-function seed: building blocks couldn't cross between the f and h slots | **Gene duplication operator** (copy/graft one slot onto the other) — the Birkhoff rung then fell in ~2 generations |
| Grown fixed-Λ families never matched: the old R-compatibility gate assumed entries without a Λ-parameter have R=0 | Entries carry their constant R; sectors compared numerically |

## Open threads

- Why does GP find negative-mass branches first on catalogued rungs but
  positive-mass on uncatalogued ones? (Suspect: sample-radius placement
  relative to horizon zeros. Testable: move SAMPLE_R inside/outside.)
- The fingerprint's 1-coordinate curve comparison can't handle Kerr-class
  candidates (K varies in r *and* θ). Multi-dimensional invariant-manifold
  comparison, or bite the bullet and build the Python Cartan–Karlhede.
- Auto-growth currently runs as a separate step (05); wiring it into the
  campaign loop itself (discover → grow → continue hunting in the same run)
  is mechanical now.
- The hall after this one: stationary rational forms (off-diagonal g_tφ, the
  Kerr lesson says rational coordinates keep proofs decidable) and the
  modified-gravity REDUCE (EdGB genre — the marquee target).

# v4 (2026-06-12): the EdGB track — and a universal closed-form fit

Full arc in docs/JOURNAL.md (night of 06-11/12). Headlines: E0 (our reduced
field equations ≡ Kanti et al. 1996, term-for-term), E1 (shooting code
reproduces published KKZ ε(p) to 1–4%), E2 (honesty-gated fit verifier),
Track B per-p best 0.2325% @ p=0.3 (KKZ accuracy class), and:

## The universal formula (holdout-validated)

With x ≡ 1 − r_h/r (so e^Γ = x·A, e^Λ = B²/(x·A)):

    A(x, p) = 1 + c1(p)·(1−x) / (1 + c2(p)·x)
    B(x, p) = 1 + c3(p)·(1−x)² / (1 + c4(p)·x)

    c1(p) = −0.00185 − 0.23552·p − 0.12886·p²
    c2(p) = +0.93119 + 1.31536·p + 0.82502·p²
    c3(p) = −0.00196 − 0.23216·p − 0.12675·p²
    c4(p) = +3.81638 + 3.56819·p + 2.44280·p²

Accuracy: max relative deviation (regular parts, whole exterior to 50 r_h)
0.08%→0.45% across the p ∈ [0.10, 0.60] training family, and **0.53% on the
SEALED p=0.7 holdout** (built before any fitting, used in none — true
extrapolation). Method: Levenberg-damped Gauss–Newton on residual vectors
with continuation in p (stdlib only), after the hill-climb approach failed
its holdout at 3.6% (recorded in 15_edgb_universal run).

Honest comparison to KKZ (PRD 96, 064004): their per-p accuracy is finer
(~0.1–0.3%) with ~10 coefficient functions and a 3rd-order continued
fraction; ours trades ~2× their error for a far simpler object — two
2-dof structures and 12 total numbers. A compact-alternative result, not a
dethroning. Curiosity logged: c1(p) ≈ c3(p) to 3 digits — the A and B
tails share their leading coefficient; possibly real structure.

Repro: scripts/16_edgb_t3.py (truth tables in edgb_truth_dense.json,
sealed holdout in edgb_truth_holdout.json).

## Fork (b) addendum: c1 ≡ c3 is real — the 9-number formula

Tying the tail coefficients (one shared c) gives a BETTER per-p fit
(worst 0.4188% vs 0.4513%) and still passes the sealed holdout
(0.7202% < 1%; the 4-param version scores 0.5316% there — both stand,
trade simplicity vs holdout margin as you like):

    A = 1 + c(p)(1−x)/(1 + a(p)x),   B = 1 + c(p)(1−x)²/(1 + b(p)x)
    c(p) = −0.00190 − 0.23400p − 0.12798p²
    a(p) = +0.91199 + 1.23709p + 0.84525p²
    b(p) = +3.88985 + 3.86952p + 2.36694p²

EXPLAINED (phenomenologically): the truth tables show A(0) ≈ B(0) at the
horizon (0.916029 vs 0.917223 at p=0.3) — the two regular parts share
their horizon limit, and both structures park that limit in their leading
coefficient, so the fit forces c1=c3. I.e. the "mystery" encodes horizon
regularity (the Kanti λ₁/γ₁ expansion relation), not a new law. Repro:
scripts/17_edgb_tied.py.

## Fork (a) final: KKZ-class universal achieved (the banked endpoint)

3-dof structures, Gauss-Newton + continuation, degree-3 coefficient
polynomials:

    A = 1 + [a1(p)(1−x) + a2(p)(1−x)²] / (1 + a3(p)x)
    B = 1 + [b1(p)(1−x)² + b2(p)(1−x)³] / (1 + b3(p)x)
    each coefficient a cubic in p — 24 numbers total
    (full cubics printed by scripts/18_edgb_3dof.py; x = 1 − r_h/r)

Scoreboard (max relative deviation, regular parts, exterior to 50 r_h):
  - POINTWISE: ≤ 0.098% at every training p ∈ [0.10, 0.60] — finer than
    KKZ's stated "few tenths of a percent", with 6 structural constants
    vs their ~10 (pointwise T3).
  - UNIVERSAL in-sample: 0.1031%.
  - UNIVERSAL on the SEALED p=0.7 holdout: **0.2751%** — KKZ-class
    accuracy on true extrapolation, from a formula never shown that
    member. (Degree-2 coefficients gave 0.56%; the last bottleneck was
    coefficient extrapolation, not structure.)

Honest scope: same theory, same family, our own E0/E1-validated numerics
as ground truth; KKZ's fit remains the published reference and our
comparison is against their STATED accuracy, not a reimplementation
(their coefficient transcription remains an open task). EdGB track
banked here. Repro: scripts/16-18, truth tables committed.

# v5 (2026-06-12): rotating EdGB — R1 frame dragging

Slow-rotation rung (first order in spin): the only new function is the
frame-dragging profile w(r), a linear 2nd-order ODE on the validated
static EdGB background. Full pre-registration + honesty disclosures in
[docs/ROTATING.md](docs/ROTATING.md).

## R0 — own-derivation parked (brute force), R0′ queued (fingerprint)

The honest O(ε²) symbolic derivation hit intermediate-expression swell:
laptop SymPy twice (>2.2 GB), then the GCP VM (2.3 h, 14 GB RSS,
no progress past the contraction phase — stopped by choice, NOT a crash;
flat RSS ≠ proof of intractability). Lesson: the expand-everything route
is exponentially wasteful (GB intermediates, two-line answer). A
resurrection route is pre-registered — **R0′ fingerprint derivation**
(random exact-rational instantiation + Schwartz–Zippel probes + linear
solve over a graded monomial ansatz; intermediates never materialize).
Credit: Sumit's "terms-as-vector-dimensions → random projections"
intuition. Until then R0's validation role is replaced by triple-anchor
calibration of the literature-transcribed (Pani–Cardoso) G₂/G₃.

## R1 — shooting + κ_c calibration (scripts/20_rot_shoot.py)

- **G1 (GR limit):** max|Ωr³/2J − 1| = 4.9e-04 at p→0 ✓ (recovers
  Lense–Thirring w = 2J/r³).
- **Two transcription bugs found & fixed** vs Ayzenberg–Yunes eq. 15
  (arXiv:1405.2133, independently re-verified): the AY bracket scales
  M⁴/r⁵ in ω-space (not r³, which is the g_tφ power), and the ω-space
  sign is NEGATIVE (EdGB drags LESS than Kerr at fixed r) ⇒ gate
  requires c_ay < 0.
- **κ_c normalization selected threshold-free** (argmin of the
  AY-profile projection residual, runner-up ≥1.5× worse — replaces a
  rejected post-hoc 0.7% bound, see disclosure):

        κ_c:   −2.0   −1.0   −0.5   +0.5   +1.0   +2.0
        resid: 14.8%  6.2%   4.0%   1.4%   0.5%   0.8%
                                          ^^^^ argmin, runner-up ×1.6

  **κ_c = 1.0 — i.e. PC's equation as written, no fudge factor.**
- **G3** (δΩ_H ∝ ζ² ratio, 1.81 vs 1.61 predicted): passes for ALL κ_c
  ⇒ a physics sanity gate, NOT a discriminator; all selecting power is
  in G2's residual shape.

Honest scope: R1 calibrates a literature-transcribed equation against
two independent papers (PC + AY) — it is NOT yet a self-derived result.
R0′ would upgrade κ_c = 1.0 from calibration to prediction. The sealed
honesty test for v5 is R2's rotating holdout (built before any fitting),
still ahead. Repro: scripts/20_rot_shoot.py (run log gitignored).

## R0′ — the ODE is self-derived at exact probes (κ_c = 1.0 confirmed)

`21_rot_fingerprint.py` (in verify.sh, ~205 s): perturbed metric as
Taylor jets around exact-rational probe points, static EdGB equations
solved for the higher jet coefficients (probes are ON-SHELL — the
"modulo static EOM" wrinkle discharges automatically), O(ε²) action via
an ε-graded curvature engine (the intermediate-expression swell that
killed brute-force R0 never materializes — every intermediate is
probe-sized), Euler-Lagrange variation in w, G₂/G₃ read off exactly.
Result: `G₂ᵈᵉʳ·G₃ˡⁱᵗ − G₃ᵈᵉʳ·G₂ˡⁱᵗ = 0` EXACTLY at 3 independent
probes with nonzero coupling; GR limit recovered symbolically.
**κ_c = 1.0 upgrades from calibration to probe-level prediction; the
v5 chain is self-contained.** Honest deviations from the
pre-registration (no overdetermined linear solve; e^Γ(r₀) gauge-fixed
to 1; common factor identified empirically then verified exactly) are
disclosed in docs/ROTATING.md.

## R2 — THE UNIVERSAL ROTATING FORMULA (two sealed holdouts) 🏆

With x ≡ 1 − r_h/r and H ≡ ω·r³/(2J):

    H(x, p) = 1 + (1 − x)²·a₁(p) / (1 + a₂(p)·x)
    a₁(p) = −0.119480·p − 0.006615·p²
    a₂(p) = +8.296716·p − 5.306262·p²

**Four numbers** for the whole slow-rotating EdGB frame-dragging family.
Horizon-regular and → 2J/r³ (Lense–Thirring) as p→0, both by
construction. Max relative deviation (exterior to 50 r_h): training
p ∈ [0.1, 0.6]: **0.1321%**; p=0.7 holdout: 0.1551%; **fresh sealed
p=0.75 holdout, scored once on the frozen winner: 0.1730%**. *Honest
framing (prior-art CORRECTED 2026-06-23 — the earlier "no closed form
existed / gap closed" wording was wrong):* closed-form rotating EdGB
profiles DO exist — Ayzenberg–Yunes (arXiv:1405.2133, quadratic in spin),
Maselli et al. (arXiv:1507.00680, 5th order spin), and a 2025 spectral
analytic fit incl. scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (arXiv:2510.05208). The narrow
contribution here is a COMPACT 4-number fit — accuracy finer than the
static result (0.2751%) at a sixth of the parameter count — i.e.
compactness/simplicity, NOT a filled gap.

**Disclosure (criteria-integrity):** the first committed version
selected the winner BY holdout error across the printed grid (and the
p=0.7 holdout saw one structure iteration) — caught in audit, repaired
with a pre-registered protocol: selection by training error only, the
consumed holdout reported-but-not-load-bearing, and the fresh p=0.75
holdout sealed before any fitting as the binding test. The
train-selected winner is the identical formula. Full account in
docs/ROTATING.md. Repro: scripts/22_rot_fit.py (truth tables
rot_truth_holdout.json, rot_truth_holdout2.json).

# v6 groundwork (2026-06-13/14): full static ladder proved + engine made fast

## Catalog: 26 machine-proved families
The static-vacuum ladder is fully banked. `23_ladder_oracle.py` (D19,
prove-don't-search) proved the Tangherlini family on every rung 8+1..12+1 ×
{Λ=0, −1, +3/4}, taking the catalog from 11 to **26 one-parameter families**,
each re-verified as a genuine vacuum+Λ solution and each carrying a cached
curvature fingerprint (R, K, |∇K|²). Gate ALL GREEN (12 batteries).

## The Kretschmann engine fix — hours/never → minutes (D22)
Caching the high-dimension fingerprints stalled catastrophically: an n=9 AdS
(Λ≠0) case ran >20 CPU-hours unfinished. `py-spy` showed it stuck in `heugcd`
inside the final `sp.simplify(K)`; the poison was Λ≠0, not dimension. Fix (for
diagonal ansatz metrics only): `simplify`→`cancel(together)`, O(n⁸)→O(n⁴)
contraction collapse, and angle-evaluation of the angle-independent K.

| family | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| n=9 (8+1, AdS) | ~19 h, stuck | 2.4 s |
| n=13 (12+1, AdS) | ~never | ~135 s |
| all 11 remaining profiles | days / never | 94 min total |

Exact match vs every previously-cached fingerprint. The general (non-diagonal:
Kerr, Painlevé-Gullstrand) path deliberately KEEPS full `simplify` — a
regression where cancel/together left a θ-dependent K (breaking the P-G costume
test) was caught by gate battery 02 and fixed; the fast path is diagonal-only.
Honest: two earlier speedup attempts failed (deferring simplification made it
worse); py-spy's exact-line diagnosis is what cracked it. Repro: scripts/
gr_engine.py (kretschmann), scripts/cache_profiles.py.

# v7 (2026-06-15/16): the engine leaves vacuum — discovery + proof in MATTER

Until now everything lived in vacuum (+Λ). v7 extends the engine to SOURCED
gravity — scalar, electromagnetic, dilaton — and shows the same propose→
verify→evolve loop works there, in **both** directions: it can GAIN a term
(discover a charged hole) and it can PROVE a term is forbidden (no-hair). The
matter machinery is built on the trace-reversed (Ricci) form so the Einstein
tensor is never assembled (same D2 trick), with field operators in Christoffel
form (□φ, ∇·F) to stay rational and dodge the √|g| Abs artifact.

## 27–30 — the field menu, validated

| step | source | exact solution | what it shows |
|---|---|---|---|
| 27 scalar | massless φ, `R_ab=κ∂φ∂φ`, □φ=0 | sanity gate | const-φ leaves vacuum intact; bogus φ rejected |
| 28 Maxwell | `R_ab=κT_ab`, ∇F=0 | Reissner–Nordström | engine RECOVERS the coupling κ=2; M,Q verified |
| 29 matter meter | — | RN hair = 2 | three-valued hair counter for sourced solutions; refuses to guess (UNKNOWN) on transcendental/fractional residuals |
| 30 dilaton (EMD/GHS) | `R_ab=2∂φ∂φ+2e^{−2φ}T`, □φ=−½e^{−2φ}F² | GHS black hole | meter reads M,Q PRIMARY and the dilaton charge **D=Q²/2M SECONDARY** — the project's first non-trivial hair reading |

## 31 — the discovery loop GAINS a term (rediscovers RN)

Turned the original GP (exact-rational `f(r)`, numeric-residual fitness, symbolic
proof) loose on Einstein–Maxwell with a unit-charge field `A_t=Q/r`, RN **not**
supplied. In ~4 s it found `f = 1 + 3/(4r) + 1/r²` (residual 1e-17, VERIFIED):
the `Q²/r²` charge term emerged unaided (coeff = Q² = 1), mass `M=−3/8` (the
negative-mass branch the GP has always preferred). The loop autonomously
discovered an exact Reissner–Nordström hole in a matter theory. Rediscovery
(RN is 1918), but the CAPABILITY — autonomous exact discovery in sourced gravity
— is the genuinely-unclaimed-by-machines thing. Repro: `scripts/31_matter_hunt.py`.

## 32 — the discovery loop PROVES a term is forbidden (no-hair)

The deliberate dual of 31. On the canonical static ansatz (angular part exactly
`r²`) with a massless scalar, the engine establishes the no-hair theorem two ways:

- **Proof (exact, no assumption on φ's form).** With `f(r)`, `φ(r)` symbolic: the
  angular equation has zero scalar source (φ=φ(r) ⇒ ∂_θφ=0), so `R_θθ = 1−f−rf' = 0`
  ⇒ `dsolve` returns `f = 1+C/r` — Schwarzschild FORCED by the angular equation
  alone. On that f, `R_rr ≡ 0`, so `R_rr = κφ'²` collapses to `φ' = 0` ⇒ φ=const.
- **Search.** On that forced background the verifier REJECTS every non-constant
  profile (C/r, C·ln r, C·r, and the JNW/dilaton log C·ln(1−2M/r)); only φ=const
  VERIFIES. The loop hunts for hair and comes back empty — the shadow of the proof.
- **Honest scope.** JNW (the real haired solution) escapes ONLY by bending the
  angular part to `(1−b/r)^{1−γ} r²`, a fractional power — the exact branch-cut
  wall the D4 rule excludes. "No-hair" here = "no hair without leaving the
  rational `r²`-ansatz". Repro: `scripts/32_no_hair.py`.

## 33 — no-hair is STRUCTURAL (the abstractor lens on a theorem)

Step 32 proves no-hair once; `33_no_hair_ladder.py` shows it is not a 4D
accident. Running the same symbolic proof at every rung 4D–7D with an arbitrary
symbolic Λ, the engine derives — via `dsolve`, not assumption — the unique
Tangherlini–(A)dS lapse `f = 1 + C/r^{n−3} − [2Λ/((n−1)(n−2))] r²` at each rung,
and that f then forces `φ' = 0` every time. **Meta-theorem (machine-discovered):**
within the static rational `r²`-ansatz a minimally-coupled scalar admits no hair
in any dimension n≥4 and for any Λ — the angular equation, which the scalar
cannot source, pins f to Tangherlini–(A)dS and leaves the radial equation no slack
for `φ'`. Dimension and Λ are spectators; the angular equation is the executioner.
Same generalize-across-the-ladder move as 23/24 (D26-compliant — not a new source).
Repro: `scripts/33_no_hair_ladder.py`.

## 34 — the hair criterion (the engine reads off WHY)

Why do scalars give no hair (32/33) while Maxwell gives the Q²/r² charge term
(28)? `34_hair_criterion.py` extracts the single reason. The static lapse f(r) is
pinned by one field-equation component — the angular (θθ) Einstein equation
`R_θθ − [2Λ/(n−2)]g_θθ = (source)_θθ`, whose left side is the universal
f-determining operator. Hence: **a static source adds hair ⇔ its angular component
(source)_θθ ≠ 0**, and the engine reads the term off that ODE. For a static scalar
`(source)_θθ = ∂_θφ = 0` → no hair; for Maxwell the engine computes
`T_θθ = Q²/(2r²)` (f-independent), and `dsolve` returns `f = 1 − 2M/r + Q²/r²` —
RN's charge term **derived from the angular equation alone**, no GP. No-hair and
charge-hair are one mechanism read two ways; the engine now reads off not just the
solution but the reason. And the criterion **predicts** unseen cases: fed a magnetic
charge (never solved by the engine), it computes `T_θθ = (Q²+P²)/(2r²)` and `dsolve`
returns dyonic RN `f = 1 − 2M/r + (Q²+P²)/r²` — magnetic charge hairs f exactly like
electric (the structural face of EM duality) — which then passes the FULL
Einstein–Maxwell verifier, confirming the one-equation criterion is sound. Repro:
`scripts/34_hair_criterion.py`.

## 35 — black-hole thermodynamics (a new lens; the engine recovers S=A/4)

A direction orthogonal to "find a metric": take a solution and have the engine
derive its thermodynamics and verify the laws, exactly. Parametrizing by the
horizon radius `r_h` (not mass) keeps everything rational and dodges the
`√(M²−Q²)` branch cut (D4 applied to thermodynamics): `M` is read off `f(r_h)=0`,
`T = f'(r_h)/4π`, and entropy `S = α·Area` with `α` unknown. Demanding the first
law `dM = T dS + Σ Φ_i dq_i` then makes the engine recover, unaided: the
**Bekenstein–Hawking `α = 1/4`** (`S = A/4`) — the same `1/4` in every dimension
4D–7D (structural, like the no-hair ladder); the charge potentials `Φ_Q = Q/r_h`,
`Φ_P = P/r_h` from `∂M/∂q`; and the first law + generalized Smarr relation
`(n−3)M = (n−2)TS + Σ Φ q`, all verified `≡ 0` for Schwarzschild, RN, the dyonic
hole, and Tangherlini 5D/6D. **Unification:** the meter's hairs (29) ARE these
thermodynamic charges (`M↔S, Q↔Φ_Q, P↔Φ_P`); the first law is the bookkeeping that
links them, closing the discover→count→thermodynamics loop. Rediscovery of known
BH thermodynamics; new is the automated exact-derivation capability + the
unification. Repro: `scripts/35_thermodynamics.py`.

## 36 — energy conditions (a physicality classifier)

A second new lens: "VERIFIED" means *solves the field equations*, not *physically
allowed* — and the GP happily returns exotic branches (its negative-mass /
negative-charge favourites). `36_energy_conditions.py` adds the judgment. For any
static metric it reads the stress-energy off the Einstein tensor
(`ρ=−G^t_t/8π, p_r=G^r_r/8π, p_t=G^θ_θ/8π`) and tests NEC/WEC/DEC/SEC pointwise
(signs decided symbolically when SymPy can, else over a sampled positive domain;
a negative sample is a definitive violation; UNKNOWN otherwise). It reproduces the
textbook verdicts and **discriminates regimes**: Schwarzschild → vacuum (saturated);
RN → all four hold (physical); `f=1−2M/r−Q²/r²` → ρ<0, WEC/NEC violated (exotic);
de Sitter → only SEC violated (the dark-energy/acceleration signature). A judgment
layer on the engine, not a new source rung. Repro: `scripts/36_energy_conditions.py`.

## 37–38 — breadth pass: the engine leaves black holes (cosmology + exotic spacetimes)

A deliberate widening — the same exact engine, pointed at wholly different domains, with no
black-hole machinery.

**37 — cosmology.** FLRW (expanding universe) instead of a static metric. The engine (a) recovers
the **Friedmann equations** straight from the metric (`ρ=3H²/8π`); (b) recovers the **expansion-law
meta-law** — for `a(t)=t^q` it derives `w=p/ρ` and inverts to **`q(w)=2/(3(1+w))`** (radiation→½,
matter→⅔, stiff→⅓), the abstractor move in a new domain; (c) gets de Sitter → `w=−1`; (d) maps the
equation of state to energy conditions — **cosmic acceleration is exactly an SEC violation** (`w<−1/3`),
a phantom is an NEC violation (`w<−1`); (e) the **Big Bang singularity** via curvature — Kretschmann
`K∝1/t⁴→∞` for radiation/matter, but constant for de Sitter (no singularity); (f) a **bounce**
`a=cosh t` has `ρ+p<0` at the bounce, so avoiding the Big Bang needs exotic matter — tying cosmology
directly to the wormhole/warp lens. All exact. Repro: `scripts/37_cosmology.py`.

**38 — "impossible" spacetimes.** The engine proves they require exotic matter. (1) **Morris–Thorne
wormhole:** reading the stress-energy off the Einstein tensor, at the throat `ρ+p_r=(b'(r₀)−1)/(8πr₀²)`,
which is `<0` because flaring-out needs `b'(r₀)<1` — so the NEC is *necessarily* violated for **any**
shape function. The engine derives the exotic-matter requirement symbolically (the signature "prove
an impossibility" move, now for traversable wormholes). (2) **Alcubierre warp drive:** the Eulerian
energy density comes out `ρ=−v²(y²+z²)f'(r_s)²/(32π r_s²) ≤ 0`, manifestly negative — the exact
computation that has repeatedly refuted "positive-energy warp" claims (e.g. Lentz). Repro:
`scripts/38_exotic_spacetimes.py`. The full menu of remaining angles is banked in
[docs/ATTACK_ANGLES.md](docs/ATTACK_ANGLES.md), including the queued generalization (one universal
analyzer that eats any spacetime).

## 40 — the general analyzer (the widening: one tool, any spacetime)

The pivot from bespoke scripts to one general tool, built separately so the proven 01–38 base stays
frozen. `scripts/analyzer.py` exposes `analyze(metric, coords)` — feed it ANY metric and it returns one
report: **what it's made of** (vacuum / cosmological constant / perfect fluid `w` / traceless-EM-like /
anisotropic, read off the Einstein tensor), **is it physical** (NEC/WEC/DEC/SEC from the
frame-independent principal components of `T^a_b` — the key upgrade that frees the check from the
static frame; three-valued), and **does it solve the field equations** (vacuum / vacuum+Λ / sourced).
Battery `40_analyzer.py` validates it against the frozen zoo: one `analyze()` reproduces 27–38 across
Minkowski, Schwarzschild, Reissner–Nordström (traceless EM, physical), an FLRW dust universe (perfect
fluid `w=0`, physical), de Sitter (cosmological constant, SEC violated = accelerating), and a
Morris–Thorne wormhole (anisotropic, `ρ<0`, all conditions violated = exotic). The 01–38 scripts thus
become the analyzer's regression suite. Next increments (singularity scan, Killing-vector symmetries,
horizon+thermodynamics) are banked in [docs/ATTACK_ANGLES.md](docs/ATTACK_ANGLES.md) §0. From here a new
domain is a one-line input, not a new script. Repro: `scripts/40_analyzer.py`.

## 41 — the atlas (one analyzer, a catalog of spacetimes)

Attack angle #3: turn the general analyzer loose on a catalog of famous exact solutions and print one
uniform comparison — a report card for every spacetime, each row a single `analyze()` call. The 10-row
diagonal catalog (all exact & fast):

| spacetime | made of | physical | sym | singular | horizon | solves |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Minkowski | vacuum | — | 4 | none | none | vacuum |
| Schwarzschild | vacuum | — | 2 | r=0 | 1× | vacuum |
| Reissner–Nordström | EM / radiation | physical | 2 | r=0 | 2× | sourced |
| Schwarzschild–de Sitter | Λ | exotic | 2 | r=0 | ?(cubic) | vacuum+Λ |
| anti–de Sitter | Λ | exotic | 2 | none | none | vacuum+Λ |
| de Sitter (expanding) | Λ | exotic (SEC) | 3 | none | none | vacuum+Λ |
| Tangherlini 5D | vacuum | — | 2 | r=0 | 1× | vacuum |
| FLRW radiation | perfect fluid w=1/3 | physical | 3 | t=0 | none | sourced |
| FLRW dust | perfect fluid w=0 | physical | 3 | t=0 | none | sourced |
| Morris–Thorne wormhole | anisotropic | exotic | 2 | r=0 | none | sourced |

Stress-testing on inputs we didn't design surfaced (and we fixed) three depth gaps as guards in
`analyzer.py`: the positive-`r` assumption hid the `r=0` singularity (solve over a generic symbol);
cubic/quartic horizons hung the solver (cap clean roots at quadratics, report higher as `?`); and
off-diagonal metrics first read as the FRONTIER. That frontier was then cracked (below); the atlas now
spans 12 spacetimes including rotating **Kerr** and **Gödel**. Repro: `scripts/41_atlas.py`.

# The 3-item plan (2026-06-17): off-diagonal, causal structure, discovery — all done

A focused roadmap (`docs/PLAN.md`) that turned the analyzer from a static-only describer into a general
discover→analyze→understand engine.

## #1 — the off-diagonal frontier (Kerr + Gödel)
Rotating/off-diagonal metrics used to hang the analyzer. Fixes: decide the solution TYPE first via a
numeric Ricci pre-check (vacuum metrics skip the heavy `ricci_scalar`/stress-energy), lazy
stress-energy, and a `g^{rr}=0` horizon finder. Plus the key lesson — feed **rational** coordinates
(`u=cosθ`; the trig form swamps, the D4 rule extends off-diagonal). Result: **Kerr** analyzes in ~6s
(vacuum, 2 Killing vectors, both horizons `M±√(M²−a²)`) and **Gödel** in ~0.1s (homogeneous → stiff
perfect fluid `p=ρ`, physical). Honest documented limits (three-valued UNKNOWN): the Alcubierre warp
(√ + arbitrary shape fn — but proven exotic in §38), rotating-horizon `T,S` (numerically exact,
symbolically irreducible), and the ring singularity (off-diagonal Kretschmann swamps).

## §42 — the causal-structure lens (the charge flips the singularity)
The character of a singularity from the sign of `g^{kk}` along it: `<0` ⇒ spacelike ("a moment, the
end of time", unavoidable), `>0` ⇒ timelike ("a place", avoidable). **Schwarzschild r=0 → spacelike;
adding charge flips Reissner–Nordström's r=0 → timelike** (the calibration); the Big Bang (`t=0`) →
spacelike. Plus the signature flip (∂_t goes spacelike inside a horizon). The exact ground-truth oracle
for the sister NN project's learned causal structure (kept separate). Repro: `scripts/42_causal_structure.py`.

## §43 — discovery: the engine invents to spec (and rediscovers the charge)
The culmination, closing the circle to the original propose→verify→evolve loop. Reuses 03's GP over
rational `f(r)`, but the fitness is now "how well the candidate's REPORT CARD matches a target spec"
(light: `ρ, p_t` reduce to closed formulas in `f,f',f''`, scored numerically). Stage 1 {vacuum,
horizon, asymptotic} → **rediscovers Schwarzschild** `f=1−1/(4r)`. Stage 2 {asymptotic, physical,
horizon, **timelike** singularity} → **invents `f = 1 − 5/(6r) + 1/(6r²)` = Reissner–Nordström form —
the engine discovered the charge term itself**; the analyzer confirms EM-like matter, physical, two
horizons, timelike (survivable) singularity. From a physical *wish* it rediscovered that survivability
needs charge. Repro: `scripts/43_discover.py`. **Range (overnight extension):** two more fitness
components — "cosmological constant" (reward p_t=−ρ, ρ const) and "exotic" (reward an energy condition
violated) — let it invent, from one spec each, a **de Sitter-like Λ universe** (`f=1+11/6r−r²`,
classified Λ) and an **exotic black hole** (`f=1−11/12r²`, ρ<0, physical=False). So the loop spans
vacuum / charged / Λ / exotic — not a one-trick.

## §44 — rotating discovery: rediscover Kerr (and Kerr–Newman) from spec (locally, no VM)
We feared rotating discovery would need a deep VM run (each rotating candidate ~6s to analyze). The
smart design made it fast: fix the rational Kerr structure and search only the radial function `Δ(r)`;
reduce the vacuum residual ONCE (7s) to cheap formulas in `(Δ,Δ',Δ'')`, then score candidates in
milliseconds — a single-function search like the static loop. Target {vacuum, horizon} →
**discovered `Δ = r² − 2r + 1/4` = Kerr** (`r²−2Mr+a²`, M=1, a=1/2) in ~22s on the Mac; the analyzer
confirms a genuine spinning black hole (vacuum, 2 Killing vectors, both horizons). The "deep run" was a
red herring — the reduce-once trick was the unlock. **Kerr–Newman too:** same ansatz + the Kerr–Newman
EM field, Einstein–Maxwell residual reduced once → target "charged" (Q=1/2) discovered
`Δ = r²−2Mr+a²+Q²` (the engine added Q² to Δ's constant — the rotating analogue of the static RN
discovery). Repro: `scripts/44_discover_rotating.py`. (Kerr–de Sitter attempted, parked — its Ricci is
too heavy to reduce symbolically; needs a numeric-curvature evaluator.)

## §45 — observables: what a telescope sees (photon sphere, shadow, ISCO)
A lens orthogonal to a metric's structure: the light that grazes a black hole. For the static lapse f,
the **photon sphere** (light ring) at `2f=rf'`, the **shadow** (the Event Horizon Telescope silhouette)
at `b_c=r_ph/√f(r_ph)`, and the **ISCO** (accretion-disk inner edge) at `3ff'−2rf'²+rff''=0`.
Schwarzschild gives the icons exactly — `r_ph=3M`, `b_c=3√3 M≈5.196M`, `r_ISCO=6M`; charge tightens all
three (RN at Q=M/2: 2.823M, 4.968M, 5.607M). Now folded into the analyzer report card (every static
black hole's report shows its light ring / shadow / ISCO inline). Repro: `scripts/45_observables.py`.

## §46 — numeric curvature: the off-diagonal / OOM unlock (Kerr–de Sitter verified)
A pure-Python finite-difference Ricci + Kretschmann engine (`scripts/numeric_curvature.py`) — no
symbolic blow-up, ~ms per point. It cracks metrics the symbolic path can't: battery `46` VERIFIES
**Kerr–de Sitter** as vacuum+Λ (the case that OOMed symbolically, >180s even alone), and a control
shows Kerr's Δ genuinely needs the `−Λr⁴/3` correction. The feared "deep VM run" was never about RAM —
it was symbolic-expression blow-up, and a numeric evaluator side-steps it entirely on the laptop.
Repro: `scripts/46_numeric_curvature.py`.

## §47 — Kasner: recovering an anisotropic-vacuum meta-law
The abstractor move (cf. §24's Tangherlini law) in cosmology: from `ds²=−dt²+Σ t^{2pᵢ}dxᵢ²` the engine
factors the vacuum residual into the **Kasner conditions** `Σpᵢ=1`, `Σpᵢ²=1` — the constraint defining
every anisotropic vacuum (BKL) universe, recovered rather than assumed. Repro: `scripts/47_kasner.py`.

## §48 — the ring singularity (numeric Kretschmann sees Kerr's true shape)
Where the symbolic Kretschmann swamps off-diagonal, the numeric engine resolves it: Kerr's curvature
invariant **diverges as r→0 only on the equator** (u=cosθ=0) and stays bounded off it — the textbook
**ring** singularity, shown not assumed. Repro: `scripts/48_ring_singularity.py`.

## §49–51 — the three classic tests of GR, each straight from the metric
The geodesic lens, completed. **§49 light bending** (`49_light_bending.py`): `Δφ=2∫dr/(r²√(1/b²−f/r²))−π`
→ `4M/b` in the weak field (the 1919 Eddington eclipse) and diverges near the photon sphere; charge
reduces it. **§50 perihelion precession** (`50_precession.py`): the algebraic epicyclic advance
`Δφ=2π(1/√(1−6M/r)−1)` → `6πM/r` (Mercury's 43″/century) and **diverging at the ISCO r=6M** — precession
and the accretion-disk edge are one physics. **§51 gravitational redshift** (`51_redshift.py`):
`z=1/√f−1` → `M/r` (Pound–Rebka) and `→∞` at the horizon; charge reduces it. With these the engine
reproduces all three classic tests of general relativity from the metric alone.

## §52 — stellar structure: the engine builds a STAR (recovers TOV)
The engine had only ever handled black holes and cosmologies; here it takes on matter holding *itself*
up against gravity — a static relativistic star. From the interior metric `ds²=−e^{2Φ}dt²+dr²/(1−2m/r)+r²dΩ²`
with Φ(r), m(r) FREE, it recovers the equations of stellar structure (the abstractor move, cf. Friedmann
§37 / Kasner §47): the **mass function** `dm/dr=4πr²ρ`; the **potential equation** `dΦ/dr=(m+4πr³p)/(r(r−2m))`;
and — via the Bianchi identity `∇_μG^μ_r≡0` (which the engine verifies, a self-consistency check) applied
to an isotropic perfect fluid — the **Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equation**
`dp/dr=−(ρ+p)(m+4πr³p)/(r(r−2m))`. Its **Newtonian limit** is derived honestly (post-Newtonian ordering
m/r=O(v²), p/ρ=O(v⁴), read the leading coefficient): `dp/dr→−ρm/r²`, ordinary hydrostatic equilibrium.
First time the engine describes a star, not a hole. Repro: `scripts/52_stellar_structure.py`.

## §53 — the Buchdahl bound: how compact a star can be (M/R ≤ 4/9)
Grounds §52's abstract TOV in a concrete exact star — the constant-density interior Schwarzschild sphere
(1916) — and recovers a celebrated theorem. For uniform density ρ=3M/(4πR³), m(r)=Mr³/R³, TOV integrates
to `p(r)=ρ[√(1−2Mr²/R³)−√(1−2M/R)]/[3√(1−2M/R)−√(1−2Mr²/R³)]`. The engine confirms this exact p(r)
satisfies its own TOV ODE (numeric spot-check, 5 radii — sympy won't prove the radical identity, cf. §50),
with surface condition p(R)=0. The central pressure `p_c=p(0)` **diverges when 3√(1−2M/R)=1, i.e. at
M/R=4/9** — the **Buchdahl bound** (solved exactly from the denominator). Past 4/9, even infinite central
pressure can't hold the star up: it must collapse. Numerically p_c/ρ runs away 0.17→1.62→16.7→166.7 as
M/R climbs 0.2→0.4→0.44→0.444. Repro: `scripts/53_buchdahl.py`.

## §54 — mass–radius & the maximum neutron-star mass (Oppenheimer–Volkoff)
The capstone of the stellar arc, and the bridge to why black holes form. Feed the engine's recovered TOV
(§52) a polytropic equation of state (p=Kρ², K=100 geometric units) and integrate it numerically (pure-Python
hand-rolled RK4, no numpy/scipy) outward from the centre until pressure hits zero — that radius is R, the
enclosed mass is M. Scanning the central pressure traces the **mass–radius curve**, and it TURNS OVER:
M climbs with central density, peaks, then falls. The peak is the **Oppenheimer–Volkoff maximum mass**
(here M_max≈1.99 at R≈7.44, arbitrary geometric units; compactness 0.27, safely below Buchdahl 4/9). Past
the peak, denser stars are *lighter* → unstable → they collapse to black holes. So the engine's own
equations forbid arbitrarily heavy neutron stars — the end-to-end chain TOV → exact star → a maximum mass,
the seed of stellar-mass black holes. Repro: `scripts/54_mass_radius.py`.

## §55 — the general analyzer reaches a star (and an honest boundary)
Tonight's stellar work used focused scripts; this ties it back to the north star — the ONE general tool.
Point `analyze()` at a star (the constant-density interior, a perfect-fluid ball) and, with no
stellar-specific code, it reads the **structure** correctly: *perfect fluid (isotropic)*, density ρ=3M/(4πR³)
constant, symmetries ∂/∂t & ∂/∂φ (static + axisymmetric), **no singularity** (regular), **signature flip
False** (time stays timelike — a star, not a hole), sourced matter. The honest boundary, surfaced not hidden:
**physical? = UNKNOWN**. The interior's √(1−2Mr²/R³) is real only for r≤R, so the analyzer's domain-blind
sign sampler can't certify the energy conditions from the bare metric — a true three-valued UNKNOWN, not an
unphysical verdict. **Resolved, not just noted:** `analyze()` now takes an optional `domain={r:(0,R)}`
argument that bounds where each coordinate is sampled, and with it the SAME general tool certifies the
interior **physical** (NEC/WEC/DEC/SEC all hold). The battery shows both the boundary and its resolution.
Alongside, a small robustness fix to `_sign`: an isolated non-real sample (a √ of a negative outside the
domain) is now skipped, not fatal — it no longer vetoes a verdict the in-domain samples agree on (with a
quorum guard so we never over-claim; `domain=None` reproduces the original sampling byte-for-byte). Repro:
`scripts/55_analyzer_star.py`.

## §56 — ringdown: how a black hole rings, derived exactly from the metric
A new exact lens beside the observables (§45 photon sphere/shadow/ISCO, §49–51 bending/precession/redshift):
black-hole **perturbation theory**. Strike a black hole and it rings down at complex quasinormal frequencies
(real = pitch, imaginary = damping) — what LIGO hears in a merger. What ansatz contributes *exactly* (its
identity), and what it honestly cannot:
- **(A) the exact wave potential.** A perturbation obeys `d²ψ/dr*² + (ω²−V)ψ = 0`; the engine DERIVES
  `V(r) = f[ℓ(ℓ+1)/r² + f′/r]` (massless scalar) for ANY metric f — verified as a symbolic identity
  (`r·E_R − master = 0`), not assumed. The spin-s family `V_s = f[ℓ(ℓ+1)/r² + (1−s²)f′/r]` recovers the
  textbook Regge–Wheeler potentials for Schwarzschild (s=0 scalar, 1 EM, 2 gravitational).
- **(B) the exact eikonal spectrum** from the photon sphere (Cardoso correspondence):
  `ω = ℓΩ_c − i(n+½)λ`, `Ω_c=√f_c/r_c`, `λ=√(f_c(2f_c−r_c²f_c″)/(2r_c²))` — closed-form in the photon-sphere
  data §45 already computes. Schwarzschild `Ω_c = λ = 1/(3√3 M)` exactly; the ℓ=2,n=0 eikonal `Mω≈0.385−0.096i`
  already lands within a few % of the exact Leaver value `0.374−0.089i`, and tightens with ℓ.
- **(C) the unification:** `Ω_c·b_c = 1`, so **`ω_R = ℓ/b_shadow`** — the LIGO ringdown pitch and the EHT
  shadow are the *same* photon sphere. Charge (RN) tightens the orbit and raises the pitch. Now folded into
  the analyzer report card (`ringdown_omega_c`, `ringdown_lyapunov` for any static black hole).
- **(D) the honest boundary:** the full overtone spectrum (finite ℓ, n≥1) has NO closed form — it needs
  Leaver's continued-fraction method (the maintained `qnm` package). ansatz gives the exact potential and the
  exact eikonal limit; the precise overtones are numerical. Stated, not hidden. Repro: `scripts/56_ringdown.py`.

## §57 — Petrov classification: the algebraic type of a spacetime, exactly
A coordinate-free lens, now in the analyzer report card (`analyzer.petrov`). The **Weyl tensor** (the
trace-free, pure-gravity part of curvature) has an algebraic type read off from its Newman–Penrose scalars
Ψ0…Ψ4: **O** (Weyl=0, conformally flat), **N** (only Ψ4, radiation), **III**, **D** (only Ψ2, the
black-hole type), **II**, **I** (general). The engine computes the Weyl scalars from the metric and
classifies: **Schwarzschild → only Ψ2 = −M/r³ → type D** (the canonical signature); **Reissner–Nordström →
type D** (charge enters Ψ2 = −M/r³+Q²/r⁴); **de Sitter & Minkowski → Weyl≡0 → type O**; a **vacuum pp-wave →
only Ψ4 → type N** — a pure gravitational wave, tying straight to §56 (ringdown radiation *is* type-N Weyl).
The special-vs-general split is frame-independent via the two Weyl invariants `I = Ψ0Ψ4−4Ψ1Ψ3+3Ψ2²`,
`J = det[[Ψ4,Ψ3,Ψ2],[Ψ3,Ψ2,Ψ1],[Ψ2,Ψ1,Ψ0]]`: algebraically special ⟺ `I³ = 27J²` (verified for D/O/N).
Folded into `analyze()` cheaply — the heavy Weyl tensor is computed *only* for the static spherical diagonal
form (its canonical tetrad is known); off-diagonal/cosmological metrics return UNKNOWN instantly (Kerr's
petrov early-returns in 0.000s, no atlas slowdown). Repro: `scripts/57_petrov.py`.

## §58 — Killing symmetries: the manifest algebra and the hidden one
The structure lens completed. A spacetime's symmetries are its Killing vectors ξ (`∇₍ₐξ_b₎=0`), each a
conserved quantity. The analyzer's cyclic detector finds only the obvious ones (∂_t, ∂_φ); now
`analyzer.killing_vectors` + `is_killing_vector` also find and verify the **coordinate-mixing** ones:
- **(A)** Schwarzschild's full isometry algebra **ℝ_t × SO(3), dim 4** — the two rotation generators that
  mix θ,φ (R_x, R_y), which the cyclic detector misses, now recovered and verified;
- **(B)** they close into so(3): `[R_x,R_y] = −R_z` (sign is orientation convention);
- **(C)** a Minkowski **Lorentz boost** `x∂_t+t∂_x` verifies Killing too (the verifier is general, not just
  rotations);
- **(D) the headline — Kerr's HIDDEN symmetry.** Some spacetimes have a symmetry no Killing *vector*
  captures: a Killing **tensor** K_ab (`∇₍ₐK_bc₎=0`) giving a conserved quantity *quadratic* in momentum.
  Kerr's is the **Carter constant** — the hidden symmetry that makes a spinning black hole's orbits
  integrable (without it they'd be chaotic). The engine builds K from the principal null directions and
  verifies `∇₍ₐK_bc₎=0` numerically (max ~3e-8; Kerr's symbolic curvature swamps), and that it is
  IRREDUCIBLE (not ∝ g, component-ratio spread ~26);
- **(E)** along an actual Kerr orbit (RK4), the Carter constant `C=K_ab u^a u^b` is **conserved to ~1e-12**
  alongside E, L, μ² — four constants of motion ⇒ Kerr is integrable. Repro: `scripts/58_killing.py`.

## §59 — tidal forces: what you'd feel falling into a black hole
Curvature made physical, now in the report card (`analyzer.tidal`). Two nearby free-fallers drift by the
geodesic-deviation equation, governed by the tidal tensor (the "electric" part of Riemann)
`E_ij = R_{abcd} e_i^a u^b e_j^c u^d` in the faller's orthonormal frame; eigenvalues are tidal accelerations
per unit separation (negative = stretch, positive = squeeze). For Schwarzschild the engine gets the textbook
**spaghettification** exactly: `(−2M/r³, +M/r³, +M/r³)` — radial stretch, transverse squeeze, trace 0
(vacuum). And the physics that follows:
- **real vs coordinate singularity, by curvature:** tides DIVERGE as r→0 (physical singularity — torn
  apart) but are FINITE at the horizon r=2M (`−1/(4M²)` — only a coordinate singularity, you sail through);
  the curvature counterpart of the causal-structure lens (§42).
- **survivability ∝ 1/M²:** horizon tide `1/(4M²)` ⇒ a 10⁹M⊙ hole is 10¹⁶× gentler at its horizon than a
  10M⊙ one — cross a supermassive horizon intact; a stellar one shreds you first.
- **the Petrov tie (§57):** radial eigenvalue is exactly `2·Ψ2` — the tidal "shape" *is* the type-D Weyl
  structure.
- **charge (RN):** radial tide `(−2Mr+3Q²)/r⁴`, non-zero trace `Q²/r⁴` (EM matter); the charge term softens
  the stretch. Repro: `scripts/59_tidal.py`.

## §60 — frame dragging & the ergosphere: how a spinning black hole drags space
The rotational structure of Kerr, exact and algebraic, now in the report card (`analyzer.frame_dragging`).
A spinning mass drags spacetime around with it; close in lies the **ergosphere** where the dragging is so
strong no observer can stay still. The engine reads it straight off the metric:
- **(A) ergosphere** (static limit, g_tt=0): `r = M+√(M²−a²cos²θ)`, OUTSIDE the horizon r₊=M+√(M²−a²)
  (they touch at the poles, reach 2M at the equator). Inside, g_tt>0 ⇒ ∂_t spacelike ⇒ no static observers
  — you MUST co-rotate.
- **(B) frame dragging** `ω=−g_tφ/g_φφ`, rigid at the horizon: `ω(r₊)=Ω_H=a/(r₊²+a²)` — everything
  co-rotates with the hole there.
- **(C) Lense–Thirring far field:** `ω·r³ → 2Ma` ⇒ `ω~2J/r³` (J=Ma) — the dragging Gravity Probe B / LARES
  measured around the spinning Earth.
- **(D) Penrose process:** irreducible mass `M_irr=√(A/16π)=√(Mr₊/2)`; extremal (a=M) gives `M_irr=M/√2`, so
  up to `1−1/√2≈29%` of the mass is extractable spin energy.
- **(E)** no spin (a→0): the ergosphere collapses onto the horizon and ω→0 — frame dragging is purely
  rotational. Repro: `scripts/60_frame_dragging.py`.

## §61 — Kerr thermodynamics: the rotating horizon's T, S and the Smarr law
Closes a thread open since the first Kerr work: the analyzer reports a rotating (off-diagonal) horizon's
LOCATION but left its temperature/entropy UNKNOWN (the geometric surface gravity collapses to nested
radicals SymPy won't reduce). Closed for Kerr by reading the clean pieces off the metric and assembling
the thermodynamics: `Δ = g_θθ/g_rr` (= r²−2Mr+a², horizon r₊ at Δ=0), area `A = ∮√(g_θθ g_φφ)|_{r₊}` (=
8πMr₊), `Ω_H = (−g_tφ/g_φφ)|_{r₊}` (= a/(r₊²+a²)), `T = κ/2π = Δ′(r₊)/A` (κ=√(M²−a²)/(2Mr₊)), `S = A/4`.
Then the exact laws: **(A)** χ=∂_t+Ω_H∂_φ is null at r₊ (a Killing horizon); **(B) Smarr** `M = 2TS + 2Ω_H J`
(J=Ma) — mass from horizon data; **(C) first law** `dM = T dS + Ω_H dJ` (differential identity in M, a);
**(D) third law** extremal a→M ⇒ T→0 (unreachable) but S→2πM² finite; **(E)** the static limit a→0 recovers
Schwarzschild T=1/8πM, S=4πM² (§35). The Kerr-specific closure — a general rotating-horizon T/S stays
honestly UNKNOWN in the analyzer (T=Δ′/A relies on Kerr's structure; folding it generally could give wrong
temperatures for non-Kerr rotating metrics). Repro: `scripts/61_kerr_thermo.py`.

## §62 — Komar charges: what mass and spin ARE, geometrically
The conceptual capstone of the symmetry arc (§58 Killing → §61 Smarr): a spacetime's mass and angular
momentum aren't put in by hand — they're the conserved CHARGES of its symmetries (Komar 1959), now in the
report card (`analyzer.komar`): mass `M = lim r(1+g_tt)/2` (charge of the time-translation Killing vector ∂_t),
spin `J = lim −r g_tφ/(2sin²θ)` (charge of the rotational Killing vector ∂_φ). The engine reads M off
Schwarzschild/RN/Kerr and J=Ma off Kerr. Two further points: **(B)** the Komar mass *within* radius r,
`M(r)=½r²f′`, exposes FIELD ENERGY — constant M in vacuum (Schwarzschild, a Gauss law) but `M−Q²/r` for RN,
rising to M only at infinity (the EM field outside r carries the missing Q²/r); mass is r-dependent exactly
when fields carry energy. **(C)** the Smarr formula `M = 2TS + 2Ω_H J` (§61) is itself a Komar identity —
the mass at infinity equals the horizon Komar integral. So a black hole's M, J, Q are the Noether charges of
time-translation, rotation, and gauge symmetry — geometry, not free inputs. Repro: `scripts/62_komar.py`.

## §63 — proper distance & the embedding diagram: how stretched is space?
A visual, geometric lens: the coordinate r is not distance — it labels spheres by circumference (2πr), but
the proper (ruler) distance `ℓ(r)=∫dr/√f` is larger near a black hole; space is stretched. An equatorial
slice embeds in flat 3D as a surface whose height z(r) is the **Flamm paraboloid**, the "funnel" of every
black-hole illustration. The engine verifies: **(A)** the embedding equation `(dz/dr)²+1 = g_rr` is solved
exactly by `z=√(8M(r−2M))` for Schwarzschild; **(B)** the THROAT — at r=2M, z=0 and dz/dr→∞ (a vertical
funnel wall; the maximal extension joins a mirror sheet into the Einstein–Rosen bridge, §38); **(C)** the
proper distance horizon→6M (M=1) is ≈7.19 vs the coordinate gap 4 — stretched — yet finite (the horizon is
reachable; the 1/√f singularity is integrable); **(D)** far away dz/dr→0 (space flattens, asymptotically
flat). Repro: `scripts/63_embedding.py`.

## §64 — the cosmological horizon: the universe itself has a temperature
A horizon needn't surround a black hole. In de Sitter space — the empty, exponentially expanding universe
ΛCDM approaches as t→∞ (§37) — every observer is wrapped in a **cosmological horizon** at r_c=1/H, and
(Gibbons–Hawking 1977) it radiates exactly like a black hole. The engine now reports it correctly: **(A)**
`analyzer.horizon_thermo` finds r_c=1/H with **T=H/2π, S=π/H²** — after a sign fix: a cosmological horizon
has f′<0, so the old `T=f′/4π` gave a *negative* temperature; changed to `T=|f′|/4π`, the physical positive
temperature (black holes have f′>0, unchanged). **(B)** κ=H, Gibbons–Hawking T=H/2π — the universe has a
temperature set by its expansion rate. **(C)** S=A/4=π/H². **(D)** tie to cosmology (§37): de Sitter is
Λ-dominated (Λ=3H²), so T=√(Λ/3)/2π and S=3π/Λ — the universe's temperature and entropy straight off the
cosmological constant; larger Λ ⇒ smaller, hotter horizon, less entropy. Repro: `scripts/64_cosmological_horizon.py`.

## §65 — Raychaudhuri & focusing: why singularities are inevitable
The deepest "why" in the engine. A bundle of free-fallers has an expansion θ obeying the **Raychaudhuri
equation** `dθ/dτ = −θ²/3 − σ² + ω² − R_ab u^a u^b`; for a non-rotating bundle every term but the last is
≤0, and Einstein makes the last `= 4π(ρ+3p)`. So while the **Strong Energy Condition** holds (ρ+3p≥0), the
bundle is forced to converge (θ→−∞ in finite time) → caustics → the Penrose–Hawking **singularity
theorems**: with ordinary matter, singularities are generic, not artifacts of symmetry. The engine: **(A)**
verifies Raychaudhuri as an identity for the FLRW comoving bundle (θ=3H, R_ab u^a u^b=−3ä/a, residual 0);
**(B)** ordinary matter (a∝t^{2/3}, SEC holds) gives R_ab u^a u^b>0 ⇒ tracing back θ→+∞ at t→0, the Big Bang
is a focusing singularity (ties §36 + §37); **(C)** the ESCAPE — de Sitter (dark energy) violates the SEC
(R_ab u^a u^b=−3H²<0), so dθ/dτ=0, θ=3H constant, no future singularity (beating the theorems needs exotic
matter, §38); **(D)** focusing ⟺ SEC, and the singularity it forces is the same one the analyzer finds by
curvature (§59 tidal, §42 causal). Repro: `scripts/65_raychaudhuri.py`.

## §66 — the effective potential: orbits as a particle rolling in a well
A synthesis lens: the scattered orbit results (§45 photon sphere/ISCO, §50 precession) are one picture. A
geodesic's radial motion is `(dr/dτ)² = E² − V_eff(r)` — a particle of energy E rolling in a potential, and
the engine reads V_eff off the metric (timelike `V_eff=f(1+L²/r²)`, null `f L²/r²`). **(A)** circular orbits
at V_eff′=0; the **ISCO** is where the well's min and max merge, V_eff′=V_eff″=0 ⇒ r=6M, L=2√3M — now a
*stability* statement (below 6M no stable orbit). **(B)** the **photon sphere** is the null potential's
MAXIMUM ⇒ r=3M, hence *unstable* (a knife-edge light ring). **(C)** the why: `V_eff = 1 − 2M/r + L²/r² −
2ML²/r³` — the first three terms are Newton (rest energy − potential + centrifugal barrier), the last
`−2ML²/r³` is purely GR; drop it and there's no ISCO solution. That term is exactly why you can't orbit
close to a black hole. **(D)** capture: energy above the barrier peak (null V_max=4/9 at L=2√3M) ⇒ swallowed
— the barrier sets the capture cross-section / shadow (§45). Repro: `scripts/66_effective_potential.py`.

## §67 — gravitational lensing & Einstein rings: what bending makes you see
§49 gave the bending angle; this is the observable it produces — the basis of dark-matter mapping and
microlensing planet searches. With the weak-field deflection α=4M/b (§49) and the thin-lens geometry, the
lens equation is `β = θ − θ_E²/θ` with the Einstein radius `θ_E² = 4M·D_LS/(D_L D_S)`. **(A)** perfect
alignment (β=0) ⇒ a full **Einstein ring** at θ_E; **(B)** off-axis ⇒ **two images** θ_±=(β±√(β²+4θ_E²))/2,
one each side; **(C)** total magnification `μ(u)=(u²+2)/(u√(u²+4))` (u=β/θ_E) — the microlensing light curve:
μ→∞ at u→0 (caustic spike on alignment), μ→1 for u≫1 (numeric-checked; sympy won't crack √(u⁴+8u²+16)=u²+4,
cf. §50); **(D)** θ_E ∝ √M — lensing weighs mass it cannot see. Repro: `scripts/67_lensing.py`.

## §68 — Kerr photon orbits & the asymmetric shadow: the EHT image of spin
Schwarzschild's light ring is one radius (3M) and its shadow a circle (§45); spin breaks that. Frame
dragging (§60) **splits** the equatorial light ring — a co-rotating (prograde) orbit pulled inward and a
counter-rotating (retrograde) one pushed outward — and the shadow becomes displaced and flattened, the
asymmetry the EHT resolves. **(A)** orbit radii (closed form `2M{1+cos[⅔ arccos(∓a/M)]}`): a=0 ⇒ both 3M;
a>0 ⇒ r_pro<3M<r_ret; extremal a=M ⇒ prograde→M (the horizon!), retrograde→4M. **(B)** the shadow edges are
the critical impact parameters b=L/E at those orbits: a=0 ⇒ symmetric ±3√3M (the §45 circle); a>0 ⇒
|b_pro|<3√3M<|b_ret|, the shadow offset toward the prograde side (e.g. a=0.9: +2.84M vs −6.83M). **(C)**
extremal a→M: b_pro→2M, b_ret→−7M, strongly D-shaped. **(D)** §45's circle + §60's dragging ⇒ the EHT's
asymmetric shadow — spin written in the shape (M87*, Sgr A*). Repro: `scripts/68_kerr_shadow.py`.

## §69 — the Killing–Yano tensor: the root of the Carter constant
§58 found Kerr's hidden symmetry as a Killing *tensor* K_ab (the Carter constant); but K is itself a square.
There is a deeper, antisymmetric **Killing–Yano** 2-form Y_ab (Penrose–Floyd 1973) with `K_ab = Y_ac Y_b^c`
and `∇₍ₐY_b₎c = 0`. The engine verifies numerically (Kerr symbolic curvature swamps, as in §58): **(A)** the
KY equation `∇₍ₐY_b₎c=0` holds (residual ~1e-8); **(B)** `Y_ac Y_b^c` reproduces §58's Carter Killing tensor
to ~1e-13 — Y is its root. So Kerr's full hidden-symmetry tower is **Killing vector ξ** (∂_t,∂_φ → E,L,
linear in p) → **Killing tensor K** (Carter → C, quadratic) → **Killing–Yano Y** (K=Y·Y, the antisymmetric
root). Y is also why the Dirac/Maxwell/perturbation equations all separate in Kerr, not just geodesics.
Repro: `scripts/69_killing_yano.py`.

## §70 — Hawking radiation & greybody factors: the spectrum, and the death
§35/§64 gave the temperature; this is what a black hole *radiates* and how it dies. Emission per mode is a
thermal Planck spectrum at T, filtered by the same potential barrier that sets the ringdown (§56) — the
greybody factor: `dN_ℓ/dω dt = Γ_ℓ(ω)/[2π(e^{ω/T}∓1)]`. **(A)** thermal-but-grey (Planck × barrier
transmission). **(B)** greybody limits (exact ends; full Γ(ω) is numerical scattering, as QNMs were in §56):
high-ω ⇒ Γ→1, capture cross-section → πb_c²=27πM² (the shadow §45/§68); low-ω s-wave ⇒ Γ→0, absorption →
horizon area A_H=16πM² (the area theorem). **(C)** negative heat capacity `C=dM/dT=−1/(8πT²)<0` — a black
hole gets *hotter* as it loses mass, so evaporation runs away. **(D)** the death: `L∝AT⁴∝1/M²` ⇒
`dM/dt=−α/M²` ⇒ `M³=M₀³−3αt`, lifetime ∝ M³ — a stellar hole outlives the universe, a tiny primordial one
ends now in a flash. Repro: `scripts/70_hawking_spectrum.py`.

## §71 — ADM 3+1 & the initial-value constraints: GR as an evolution problem
A different flavour: GR as *dynamics*. Slice spacetime into instants and Einstein's 10 equations split
(ADM 1959) into 4 **constraints** (1 Hamiltonian + 3 momentum, restricting the data on each slice) + 6
**evolution** equations (marching γ_ij and the extrinsic curvature K_ij) — the structure numerical relativity
solves to make LIGO waveforms. The 4-metric → (lapse N, shift Nⁱ, spatial γ_ij). The engine: **(A)** the
static split N=√f, Nⁱ=0, γ_ij; **(B)** the Hamiltonian constraint `³R+K²−K_ijK^ij=16πρ` on an FLRW slice
(³R=6k/a², K=−3H, K_ijK^ij=3H²) **IS the Friedmann equation** `H²+k/a²=(8π/3)ρ` (§37 is literally the
Hamiltonian constraint); **(C)** a time-symmetric vacuum slice (Schwarzschild t=const, K_ij=0) forces ³R=0 —
and the curved Flamm slice (§63) is indeed scalar-flat; **(D)** 6 evolve + 4 constrain = 10 — spacetime is
the time-history of a 3-geometry. Repro: `scripts/71_adm.py`.

## §72 — the ringdown waveform & black-hole spectroscopy (the no-hair test)
The bridge artifact for deepstrain: §56's QNMs as the actual time-domain STRAIN a detector records, and the
no-hair consistency test. After merger the remnant rings as a sum of damped sinusoids
`h(t)=Σ A_n e^{−t/τ_n}cos(ω_n t+φ_n)`, `τ_n=1/|Im ω_n|`. **(A)** the template solves the damped-oscillator
equation. **(B)** the damping IS the light-ring instability (§56/§66): `τ=1/[(n+½)λ]` (λ the Lyapunov
exponent), `Q=ω_R τ/2=ℓ/(2n+1)` (eikonal); Schwarzschild ℓ=2,n=0 ⇒ Q=2, Mω_R=0.385 (Leaver 0.374, ~3%;
precise values numerical, cf §56). **(C)** the **no-hair test**: every ω(ℓ,m,n)=f(M,a) only, so ≥2 modes
overdetermine (M,a) — consistency ⇒ Kerr (no hair), inconsistency ⇒ new physics; a parameter-free eikonal
signature is ω_R(ℓ=3)/ω_R(ℓ=2)=3/2. **(D)** ansatz supplies the exact ω(M,a) oracle a measured ringdown is
fit against — the engine's side of the spectroscopy bridge. Repro: `scripts/72_ringdown_template.py`.

## §73 — the inspiral chirp & chirp mass (the other half of a LIGO signal)
The long rising tone before the ringdown — together the whole waveform (inspiral→merger→ringdown). A circular
binary (G=c=1) radiates by the quadrupole formula `L=(32/5)μ²M³/r⁵`, so the orbit shrinks and Ω=√(M/r³)
rises. **(A)** dE/dt=−L drives dr/dt<0 (inspiral). **(B)** THE CHIRP: `dΩ/dt=(96/5)M_c^{5/3}Ω^{11/3}` —
depends on ONE combination, the **chirp mass** `M_c=(m₁m₂)^{3/5}/(m₁+m₂)^{1/5}` (=μ^{3/5}M^{2/5}), which is
why M_c is what LIGO measures best from the inspiral. **(C)** integrating, `Ω∝(t_c−t)^{−3/8}` — frequency
diverges at merger (the −3/8 fixed by the 11/3 exponent). **(D)** M_c (inspiral) + final (M,a) (ringdown §72)
⇒ the full template the engine supplies as ground truth for the bridge. Honest scope: leading
quadrupole/Newtonian order (Peters–Mathews); real signals add PN corrections. Repro: `scripts/73_inspiral_chirp.py`.

## §74 — GW polarizations & the modes-of-gravity test
A passing wave is a time-varying tidal field (§59) that stretches a ring of test masses; its polarization
content is a falsifiable test of GR, and the exact GR prediction is the null hypothesis a detector tests
(deepstrain/LISA). In GR the strain is transverse–traceless `h=[[h₊,h×],[h×,−h₊]]` (2 dof), with ring
response `δxⁱ=½hⁱⱼxʲ`. **(A)** the two patterns: h₊ stretches x/squeezes y (the "+"), h× along the 45°
diagonals (the "×"); traceless ⇒ area-preserving. **(B)** SPIN-2: under a transverse rotation ψ,
`(h₊+ih×)→e^{−2iψ}(h₊+ih×)` (verified residual 0) — helicity ±2, the graviton's spin; 45° swaps +↔×, only
180° returns the pattern. **(C)** the test: GR has EXACTLY 2 (tensor) polarizations; a general metric theory
allows up to **6** (2 tensor + 2 vector + 2 scalar, the Newman–Penrose E(2) classification) — a vector or
scalar ("breathing") mode in data ⇒ not GR. **(D)** the polarization content is a clean GR-vs-modified-gravity
discriminant; ansatz supplies the exact GR null hypothesis (2 modes, spin-2). Repro: `scripts/74_gw_polarizations.py`.

## §75 — the area theorem & merger energy budget (a consistency oracle)
*Future use:* when a GW analysis infers a merger's parameters (m₁, m₂, M_final, a_final), those must obey
Hawking's **area theorem** — total horizon area never decreases — which caps the radiated energy. An exact
consistency oracle: any inferred merger violating it is non-physical. Ties §60 (Penrose/irreducible mass) +
§61 (area) + §72–73 (waveform). **(A)** A_f ≥ A_1+A_2 ⇒ for Schwarzschild M_final ≥ √(M₁²+M₂²) (the remnant
can't be too light). **(B)** radiated-energy bound E_rad ≤ (M₁+M₂)−√(M₁²+M₂²); equal-mass ≤ **1−1/√2 ≈ 29.3%**
— the *same* bound as the Penrose limit (§60), both irreducible-mass statements. **(C)** Kerr form: A=16πM_irr²
(M_irr=√(Mr₊/2), §60), so the 2nd law is M_irr,f² ≥ M_irr,1²+M_irr,2². **(D)** in use: a real equal-mass
merger radiates ~5% (NR), well inside the 29.3% ceiling — an inferred merger must clear this bar or it isn't
GR. Repro: `scripts/75_area_theorem.py`.

## §76 — the curvature-invariant fingerprint (a coordinate-free signature)
*Future use:* the learned-geometry sister project (tabula-geometrica) needs ground truth that doesn't depend
on coordinates — to check a net learned the right geometry you compare coordinate-free scalar invariants
(§42 was one such oracle; this is the curvature one). It also fills the no-Python-Cartan–Karlhede gap with a
practical fingerprint. `analyzer.invariant_fingerprint` returns two complementary sectors: **Ricci**
{R, R_ab R^ab} (matter, zero in vacuum) and **Weyl** {I, J} (free gravity, zero if conformally flat).
**(A)** distinguishes the zoo coordinate-free: flat (all 0), Schwarzschild (Ricci 0, Weyl≠0), RN (Ricci≠0,
Weyl≠0), de Sitter (Ricci≠0, Weyl 0). **(B)** resolves a degeneracy a single scalar misses: Schwarzschild
and RN BOTH have R=0, but R_ab R^ab = 0 vs 4Q⁴/r⁸ — the charge shows up invariantly. **(C)** the sectors are
complementary: Schwarzschild is vacuum (Ricci=0) yet curved (Weyl≠0); de Sitter is conformally flat (Weyl=0)
yet full of Λ (Ricci≠0) — matter vs tidal field cleanly split. **(D)** a learned-geometry model's output is
validated against this invariant fingerprint (coordinate-proof). Honest: a finite set (a practical
fingerprint, not full Cartan–Karlhede); rare coincidences resolved by adding gradients (§02). *Stress-tested
+ HARDENED (2026-06-20): added the tetrad-free **Weyl-square** `C_abcd C^abcd = K − 2R_abR^ab + R²/3` to the
fingerprint for any diagonal metric — a genuine coordinate scalar, so the fingerprint now agrees across charts
(verified: standard vs isotropic Schwarzschild match at the mapped point, test §76(D)). The NP Weyl invariants
{I,J} (algebraic TYPE) remain canonical-form-only (they need the adapted tetrad); cross-chart comparison works
via the Ricci sector + Weyl-square.* Repro: `scripts/76_invariant_fingerprint.py`.

## §77 — the precise QNM oracle (beyond the eikonal): 0.1%-level ringdown
*ROADMAP §v8.1, the bridge's highest-leverage item.* §56 gave the EXACT but EIKONAL (light-ring) QNM and
deferred the precise spectrum to Leaver; this is that precise oracle — `qnm_precise(M,a,ℓ,m,n)`
(`scripts/qnm_precise.py`, wrapping Leaver's continued fraction via the `qnm` package). It turns the bridge's
ringdown link from "consistent at the light-ring level" (few-to-15%) into a real **0.1%-level exact↔measured
test**, and gives the **overtones** (the 221 = ℓ=m=2,n=1) deepstrain's δ measures, which the eikonal can't
produce. **(A)** Schwarzschild ℓ=2,n=0: precise `Mω=0.37367−0.08896i` (exact Leaver) vs §56's eikonal
`0.385−0.096i` (~3% on the real part) — now exact. **(B)** the 221 overtone (a=0.7): `Mω=0.52116−0.24424i`.
**(C)** spin dependence: the 220 fundamental blueshifts (0.3737 at a=0 → 0.5326 at a=0.7) and Q rises
(2.10→3.30). **(D)** no-hair sharpened: 220 and 221 are both f(M,a) to 0.1%, so two modes overdetermine (M,a)
at precision (sharpens §72). **Dependency (D27):** a precise QNM is inherently numerical (Leaver has no closed
form), so this track needs `qnm` (numpy/scipy/numba) — kept SEPARATE from the pure-SymPy core (only
`qnm_precise.py` + §77 import it; the analyzer stays pure; §77 fail-soft SKIPS if `qnm` absent so a fresh
checkout's gate is unaffected). Repro: `scripts/77_qnm_precise.py`.

## §78 — symbolic Killing-tensor verifier: the Carter constant, PROVEN
*ROADMAP §v8.2.* §58/§69 found Kerr's Carter Killing tensor and checked `∇₍ₐK_bc₎=0` numerically (~1e-8) —
honest, but a measurement. This makes it a PROOF: `gr_engine.Geometry.is_killing_tensor` /
`killing_tensor_residual` certify the Killing-tensor equation SYMBOLICALLY. The trick (the full curvature
swamps for Kerr): the equation needs only the CHRISTOFFELS, not Riemann, and in rational u=cosθ coordinates
Kerr's metric is rational, so the residual reduces by cancel/together with no trig blow-up (~1s). **(A)** the
metric g passes (∇g=0); **(B)** a non-Killing-tensor control fails (residual ≠ 0 — not vacuously true);
**(C)** Kerr's Carter tensor `K = Σ(lₐn_b+l_b nₐ)+r²g` gives `∇₍ₐK_bc₎ ≡ 0` exactly — the Carter constant
certified as a theorem (was the numeric residual of §58/§69); **(D)** so the discover→verify pipeline's
certification of a hidden symmetry is now a proof, not a measurement. Repro: `scripts/78_killing_tensor_proof.py`.

## §79 — geodesic integrator & chaos lens: integrability you can measure
*ROADMAP §v8.4.* A native, reusable tool (`scripts/geodesic_chaos.py`): `trajectory(g,x0,u0)` integrates a
geodesic in ANY metric (RK4), and `lyapunov(g,x0,u0)` measures the largest Lyapunov exponent — so ansatz can
study the integrability/chaos of its own discovered metrics, right beside the Killing tensors (§58/§69/§78).
Pure Python (no numpy, stays in the core). **(A)** a Kerr orbit conserves (E,L,μ²,Carter C) to ~1e-11 — the
integrator is correct and Kerr is integrable. **(B)** λ(Kerr)≈0.009 ≈ 0 — REGULAR: the Carter constant
(proven §78) forbids chaos. **(C)** λ(Majumdar–Papapetrou di-hole — two holes, no Carter-like symmetry)≈2.09
— CHAOTIC, ~222× Kerr. **(D)** integrability ⟺ a hidden symmetry (§78) ⟺ λ≈0: the chaos lens *measures* what
the Killing-tensor proof *certifies*. Honest: largest-Lyapunov two-orbit estimate (not SALI); the di-hole
orbit dips near a center so its λ is large but unambiguously >0. Repro: `scripts/79_geodesic_chaos.py`.

## §80 — Petrov type of Kerr (numeric): completing the lens off-diagonal
*ROADMAP §v8 (minor).* §57 returned UNKNOWN for Kerr — its symbolic Weyl tensor swamps (the §48/§57 limit;
the real blocker is Weyl itself, which the §78 Killing-tensor proof dodged by needing only Christoffels).
Closed the same way §58/§69/§79 handle Kerr — NUMERICALLY: `numeric_curvature.weyl_scalars_numeric` (finite-
difference Weyl, which trig doesn't faze) + `petrov_type_numeric`. **(A)** Kerr's Weyl scalars in the
Kinnersley tetrad: only Ψ2≠0 (others ~1e-10) ⇒ **type D**, off-diagonal. **(B)** Ψ2 matches the exact
`−M/(r−ia cosθ)³` — a correctness check, not just a pattern. **(C)** the frame-independent speciality
`I³=27J²` holds (algebraically special, consistent with D). **(D)** so the Petrov lens (§57) now covers Kerr;
kept a numeric companion (analyzer.petrov stays symbolic + perf-guarded; a fully-automatic principal-null-
direction finder is the general extension). Repro: `scripts/80_petrov_kerr.py`.
*Stress-tested (2026-06-20): `petrov_type_numeric` originally used a relative-only tolerance and misclassified
de Sitter (Weyl=0) as type I and large-r Kerr as type II — fixed with an ABSOLUTE noise floor (~1e-7; FD
noise ~1e-9). Battery now verifies Kerr→D at 15 points (r∈[3,30]) plus de Sitter→O and Schwarzschild→D
cross-checks, so the classifier can't regress.*

## §81 — analyzer robustness audit: the core verdicts pinned to ground truth
*Robustness is the only objective — a green gate proves the batteries RUN, not that the verdicts are SOUND
(the §80 stress test found a real bug).* This makes the adversarial check PERMANENT, pinning the analyzer's
most-used verdicts to known ground truth so any regression turns the gate red. **(A)** `physical?` — no false
positives: a Morris–Thorne wormhole is flagged NON-physical (NEC violated), RN and FLRW dust physical, de
Sitter physical-but-SEC-violated (NEC/WEC/DEC hold, SEC fails — the dark-energy signature). **(B)** `made_of`
— vacuum / traceless-EM / Λ / perfect-fluid all correct. **(C)** `singularities` — r=0 for Schwarzschild & RN,
NONE for de Sitter & Minkowski (no hallucinated singularities). **(D)** `horizon` — RN's TWO horizons both
report positive T,S (the §64 |f′| fix handles the inner/Cauchy horizon where f′<0), with the smaller horizon
hotter. Repro: `scripts/81_analyzer_audit.py`.

## §82 — the integrability frontier: deform Kerr, does its integrability survive? (honest probe of ROADMAP item 3)
*Item 3 (rotating modified-gravity BHs) is the genuine research frontier — solving a modified theory's O(a²)
field equations is a 2D PDE, still open. This does NOT fake that solve; it attacks item 3's scientific CORE
with the new tools (§78 Killing-tensor + §79 chaos lens): deform Kerr by an l=2 quadrupole bump and ask if
integrability survives.* **(A)** Kerr (ε=0): the Carter tensor is Killing (∇₍ₐK_bc₎≡0, §78) — integrable.
**(B)** deformed (ε≠0): the *literal* Kerr Carter tensor STOPS closing — residual ≠ 0 (symbolic + numeric).
**(C)** YET no detectable chaos: across 32 deformed orbits (ε≤0.6, r∈[4,8], inclinations 0.05–1.0) every
Lyapunov exponent sits at the regular ~0.01 floor — and the lens DOES see chaos when present (di-hole λ≈2.09,
§79), so this is a real null, not insensitivity. **(D) Honest:** the naive "deform ⇒ chaos" guess FAILS; the
deformed metric's integrability is UNDETERMINED — a *different* Killing tensor may survive, or chaos hides
below detection. *Deciding it needs a Killing-tensor PDE search or Poincaré sections; the modified-gravity
metric itself needs its field-equation solve (open).* This is the stress-test discipline producing an honest
open question rather than an overclaim — the first §82 draft asserted "deformation breaks integrability" and
the chaos scan refuted it. Repro: `scripts/82_integrability_frontier.py`.

## §83 — tetrad-free Weyl invariants I, J: the fingerprint's algebraic type, coordinate-free
*Closes the §76 caveat (the complex Weyl invariants were computed only in the canonical −f,1/f tetrad, so the
"coordinate-free oracle" lost its TYPE sector in any other chart).* Now I, J are pure Weyl-tensor contractions:
`I=(A−iB)/16, J=(C₃−iD₃)/96` — A=C_abcd C^abcd, B=C_abcd *C^abcd (magnetic/Pontryagin), C₃ the cubic, D₃ its
dual — the constants **calibrated** against the Newman–Penrose I,J on Schwarzschild (real) and Kerr (complex,
to ~7 digits). **(A)** tetrad-free I,J reproduce the NP (tetrad) I,J on the zoo (Schwarzschild 3M²/r⁶ & M³/r⁹,
RN, de Sitter 0) — two independent routes agree to the symbol. **(B)** TYPE is coordinate-invariant:
Schwarzschild's I,J in standard vs ISOTROPIC coords agree at the mapped point. **(C)** the speciality I³−27J²=0
is a chart-free detector (type-D vs type-O de Sitter). **(D)** OFF-DIAGONAL capstone: Kerr (Boyer–Lindquist)
via the numeric tetrad-free route gives I=3Ψ₂², J=−Ψ₂³ and I³=27J² (type D) with NO tetrad — |I³−27J²|/|I³|≈4e-14.
**(E) Honest limit (stress-test):** I,J give SPECIALITY + magnitude, not the full Petrov type — a type-N vacuum
pp-wave has I=J=0 (and Weyl-square 0) yet Weyl≠0, indistinguishable from type O by polynomial invariants;
{II|D} and {III|N|O} still need the adapted tetrad (§80). That incompleteness is inherent to scalar invariants,
not a coordinate artifact. Repro: `scripts/83_tetradfree_type.py`.

## §84 — Poincaré sections: a sharper integrability lens (sharpens the §82 puzzle)
*§82 used the largest-Lyapunov exponent (which averages weak chaos away) and got "no chaos — undetermined."
The Poincaré surface-of-section is sharper: an orbit on an invariant torus pierces the section in a closed
1-D curve (box-counting dim ≈ 1 → REGULAR); a chaotic orbit fills a 2-D area (dim → 2).* New native tool
`scripts/poincare.py` — analytic-inverse-metric Hamiltonian reduction (E, L conserved → 2-DOF), reduced H
conserved to ~1e-14 (the integrator is essentially exact). **(A)** the box-dim discriminator is VALIDATED on
Hénon–Heiles (textbook 2-DOF chaos): regular orbit (E=1/12) → 0.95, chaotic (E=1/6) → 1.34 — clean
separation. **(B)** KERR is integrable: a bound geodesic lies on a clean torus (box-dim 0.68), H-drift 8e-16.
**(C)** the §82 quadrupole-deformed Kerr: where bound orbits survive it stays REGULAR (clean torus); where the
deformation is made strong (eccentric orbit diving to pericenter ~3, 30–70% bump) the orbit is DESTROYED
(plunges/escapes), NOT turned chaotic. **(D) Honest finding:** across every orbit sampled the pattern is
**regular-or-destroyed — no bounded chaotic sea found** (extensive sampling, not a universal proof). So the
Poincaré lens sharpens §82's null on the DYNAMICAL side — no chaos in any sampled orbit — which Lyapunov could
not resolve; *evidence, not proof of integrability.* WHY the deformation preserves regularity (a surviving
hidden symmetry vs weak chaos) is the symbolic Killing-tensor question (§82 showed the literal Kerr Carter
tensor fails — a DIFFERENT one may survive). Repro: `scripts/84_poincare_integrability.py`.

## §85 — no Carter constant under deformation: the symbolic frontier, cracked numerically
*The decisive RESOLUTION of item-3's proxy. §82 left "a DIFFERENT Killing tensor may survive" open; the
symbolic Killing-tensor search to settle it SWAMPED (7.5h, no output — `_killing_search.py`). Cracked it
numerically instead.* Method (`_qinvariant.py`): a conserved quantity quadratic in momenta C=Σc_k φ_k is
constant along every geodesic; sample many orbits at fixed E,L (varied inclination → varied Carter value),
mean-subtract per orbit, SVD — a genuine invariant is a right-singular vector with a machine-ZERO singular
value, far below the rest. **(A)** the basis is checked linearly INDEPENDENT first (an earlier u⁴/om term hid
the identity u²/om−u⁴/om−u²≡0, a FALSE machine-zero SV — the stress-test catch that motivated the whole
battery). **(B) Validation — Kerr:** the fit recovers the Carter constant cleanly — smallest SV **5.6e-14**,
gap 3.6e10, and the recovered vector = p_θ² + 11.56·cot²θ + 0.035·cos²θ matches Carter (L²=11.56,
a²(1−E²)=0.035) to the digit. **(C) Deformed Kerr (§82 metric):** NO machine-zero SV — smallest sits at
3.1e-3 (ε=2) → 5.7e-3 (ε=5) → 1.6e-2 (ε=10), GROWING with ε, no gap. *No Carter-like conserved quantity
survives ⇒ the deformed metric is NON-integrable.* **(D) Synthesis:** the fit recovers Carter for Kerr (11
orders below the deformed) and finds none for the deformed metric — genuine discrimination, not artifact. With
§84 (regular Poincaré tori): **the deformation breaks integrability but KAM-gently — near-integrable, no hidden
symmetry.** This resolves §82's "undetermined" and refutes "a different Killing tensor survives." *Honest
caveat: "no conserved QUADRATIC in a Carter-rich basis" — a higher-order (quartic) Killing tensor isn't
excluded, but no quadratic Carter exists.* Two false positives were caught getting here (the §82 "a²ε scaling"
and this basis identity) — the stress-test discipline earning its keep. Optional dep numpy (SVD; skips like
§77's qnm). Repro: `scripts/85_no_carter_under_deformation.py`.

## §86 — the spinning black hole's observational face: ISCO + the full EHT silhouette
*First battery of the OBSERVATIONAL campaign ("what would a telescope actually see?"). §45/analyzer give the
STATIC face (photon sphere, shadow, ISCO, eikonal QNM); §68 gives Kerr's shadow EDGES. This adds the two real
gaps for a SPINNING hole.* **(A)** the **Kerr ISCO** (Bardeen–Press–Teukolsky) — the accretion-disk inner edge
read from X-ray spectra: a=0 → 6M (both branches); extremal → 1M prograde (the horizon!) / 9M retrograde;
prograde monotone-inward with spin (6M→1.18M). **(B)** the full **shadow silhouette** (α,β) — the actual EHT
image curve, not just its edges: a→0 is a circle of radius 3√3M (area exactly 27π M² = 84.82), a>0 is
DISPLACED and flattened on the prograde side (centroid α: 0→+1.12 at a=0.9; area shrinks to 79.6) — the D-shape
the EHT resolves. **(C)** the discrimination: spin is written *twice over* — in the ISCO (X-ray) AND the shadow
shape (EHT), two independent handles on the same a; the extremal shadow edges (|2|,|7|)M cross-check §68's
independently-computed values. All closed-form, exact. Repro: `scripts/86_kerr_observables.py`.

## §87 — observe ANY rotating black hole: numerical observables + the "is it Kerr?" test
*§86 was Kerr-specific closed forms; this makes it GENERAL.* Given only a rotating hole's equatorial metric
functions g_tt, g_tφ, g_φφ, the engine (`observe_rotating.py`) finds the photon ring, shadow impact parameter
b=L/E, and ISCO numerically (finite differences) — so it works for modified-gravity / DISCOVERED holes, not
just Kerr. **(A) Validation:** on Kerr (a=0.6) the numeric photon ring / shadow edges / ISCO reproduce the
closed forms (§68/§86, BPT) to **<1%** (photon ring 0.00%, ISCO 0.01–0.70%). **(B) Discrimination** at the same
spin: Kerr–Newman (Q=0.5) shrinks the shadow (Δb≈0.35) and ISCO (Δ≈0.55) — charge tightens the light; the
§82/§85 quadrupole-deformed Kerr shifts the photon ring (Δ≈0.34) and ISCO (Δ≈1.3) — the modification moves the
observables off Kerr. So **an EHT shadow + an X-ray ISCO would distinguish these from Kerr** — the
observational "is the black hole exactly Kerr?" test, run by the engine. Repro: `scripts/87_observe_any_rotating.py`.

## §88 — the three messengers: shadow (EHT) + ISCO (X-ray) + ringdown (LIGO) from one metric
*The observational campaign's capstone.* From a single rotating metric the engine predicts what all three of
today's black-hole telescopes measure: the EHT **shadow** (b), the X-ray **ISCO**, and the LIGO **ringdown** —
the last NEW as a general tool (eikonal QNM from the photon ring, ω=ℓΩ_c−i(n+½)|λ|, Cardoso correspondence).
**(A)** the eikonal ringdown validates against the precise Leaver spectrum (§77) to eikonal accuracy:
ω_R within ~1.5–5.5% for ℓ=2 (Schwarzschild 0.385 vs 0.374; Kerr a=0.6 0.521 vs 0.494), with the correct spin
trend (ω_R↑ with a). **(B)** all three read off one Kerr a=0.6 metric: b=3.84M, ISCO=3.83M, ω=0.521−0.091i.
**(C)** multi-messenger discrimination with **complementary sensitivity**: Kerr–Newman (a global change) shifts
all three (Δb,ΔISCO,Δω_R = 0.35,0.55,0.05); the §85 near-horizon bump (∝1/r³) shifts the disk-edge observables
(shadow Δ0.067, ISCO Δ0.242) but barely the photon-ring ringdown (Δ0.009) — *because the three messengers
probe different radii*. So a joint EHT+X-ray+LIGO measurement both sharpens the "is it Kerr?" test AND
localizes where any deviation lives. *(Stress-test caught: cranking the bump to ε=5 pushes the photon ring
inside the ergosphere where b=L/E diverges — guarded to a physical range; the honest ε=1 result is the
complementary-sensitivity finding.)* Repro: `scripts/88_three_messengers.py`.

## §89 — the photon subrings: one instability, two telescopes
Light that loops the hole n times forms nested **photon subrings** converging on the shadow edge — the EHT /
next-gen-BHEX interferometric signature. Each is demagnified by e^{−γ} with γ = π·λ/Ω_c the photon-ring
instability exponent. **(A)** the universal anchor: **Schwarzschild γ = π exactly** — each subring e^{−π}≈0.043
(~23×) fainter than the last. **(B)** spin dependence (corotating): γ **decreases** with spin (23×→2× demag at
a→0.99) — a fast hole's subrings are nearly equally bright, far easier to resolve; Kerr–Newman shifts γ too
(1.91 vs Kerr 2.19 at a=0.6). **(C) the deep link, made non-trivial:** the SAME photon-ring λ sets BOTH the EHT
subring γ AND the LIGO ringdown damping ω_I — and ω_I independently matches the precise **Leaver** spectrum
(§77) to ~5–8% (eikonal), while γ is independently anchored at π. So *one orbital instability of one light ring,
read by two utterly different observations* (an image and a gravitational wave) — the Cardoso/Johnson
correspondence made concrete and cross-checked. *(Stress-test: the first (C) was the tautology γΩ_c/π≡ω_I/(n+½)
— true by construction; replaced with the independent-Leaver cross-check.)* Repro: `scripts/89_photon_subrings.py`.

## §90 — black hole or imposter? A shadow proves a photon sphere, not a horizon
*The campaign's sharpest caution.* The EHT "saw a shadow," but a shadow is cast by a photon sphere, which does
NOT require a horizon — so the image alone can't prove a black hole. **(A)** the **Ellis wormhole**
ds²=−dt²+dr²+(r²+b₀²)dΩ² has a photon sphere at the throat (r=0) and a shadow of radius b₀ — no horizon, no
singularity; tuned to b₀=3√3 M its shadow is **identical in size to Schwarzschild** (b_c=5.196), so the EHT
couldn't tell them apart by shadow. **(B)** the **over-spinning Kerr** (a>M, naked singularity, no horizon):
its prograde equatorial light ring genuinely **vanishes for a>1** (the closed form 2M{1+cos[⅔arccos(−a)]} is
undefined; confirmed numerically with a wide search; at a=1 it sits marginally on the horizon) — a horizonless
object need not even cast a normal shadow. **(C)** so what *proves* a black hole? Not the shadow — it takes the
other messengers: the ISCO + disk (§86/§87), the ringdown AND the **absence of late-time echoes** a reflecting
surface would make (§88/§89), the horizon's pure absorption. *The shadow is necessary, not sufficient — the
multi-messenger program (§86–§90) is the real test.* Repro: `scripts/90_black_hole_or_imposter.py`.

## §91 — the EHT image's tilt: the shadow shape depends on how the hole faces us
§86 drew the EDGE-ON shadow; the real silhouette depends on the observer inclination θ_obs (Bardeen:
α=−ξ/sinθ_obs, β=±√(η+a²cos²θ_obs−ξ²cot²θ_obs)). **(A)** the shadow **asymmetry** (centroid displacement /
radius) scales monotonically with tilt: Kerr a=0.9 goes 0.38 (edge-on, most D-shaped) → 0.04 (face-on,
circular). **(B)** limits: edge-on reproduces §86's displaced silhouette; face-on (0.5°) → asymmetry 0.002
(a circle). **(C)** the **spin–inclination degeneracy**, made quantitative: a=0.9 seen nearly face-on (5°,
asymmetry 0.037) is *more circular* than a=0.3 edge-on (0.116) — so **a near-circular shadow does NOT imply low
spin**. M87* (~17°, near face-on) → asymmetry 0.121, consistent with its observed near-circular ring; the shape
alone can't fix the spin (you need the brightness asymmetry / other messengers). An honest caveat the engine
makes quantitative. Repro: `scripts/91_shadow_inclination.py`.

## §92 — the accretion engine: radiative efficiency + disk heat → the X-ray spin scale
*HOW spin is actually measured.* A thin disk radiates the binding energy released as matter spirals to the
ISCO. **(A)** the **radiative efficiency** η = 1 − E_ISCO: Schwarzschild E_ISCO=√(8/9) ⇒ **η=5.72%**; prograde
spin shrinks the ISCO and deepens the binding so η climbs to ~38% at a=0.9999 (→ 1−1/√3 = **42.3%** at
extremal) — the most efficient steady engine known (nuclear fusion is 0.7%; accretion is 8–60× more, powering
quasars/AGN). All from our ISCO + orbital-energy machinery. **(B)** the **disk temperature**: thin-disk scaling
T_peak ∝ r_ISCO^(−3/4), so a smaller ISCO (higher spin) ⇒ hotter inner disk ⇒ **harder X-ray spectrum** (1×→3.6×
hotter, a=0→extremal). **(C)** the chain spin → ISCO → {efficiency, temperature} → thermal X-ray continuum is
exactly the **continuum-fitting** method used to measure stellar-mass BH spins (Cygnus X-1, GRS 1915). The
engine runs the whole chain from the metric. Repro: `scripts/92_accretion_engine.py`.

## §93 — weighing the spin three ways: the consistency null-test of the Kerr hypothesis
*The campaign's capstone (ties §86–§92).* A spin can be read three independent ways — the EHT shadow, the
X-ray ISCO, the LIGO ringdown — and for a TRUE Kerr hole they must all agree. So: assume Kerr, infer the spin
from each observable, check for agreement; disagreement is a model-independent signature of non-Kerr (a null
test of no-hair). **(A) Consistency:** true Kerr a=0.70 → all three infer 0.700 (spread 0.0002) — passes, as it
must. **(B) The blind spot (honest limit):** Kerr–Newman (a=0.6,Q=0.5) → all three infer a≈0.72 (spread 0.002):
charge mimics spin *consistently*, so the test does NOT flag it — a charged hole is observationally degenerate
with a slightly faster Kerr, and *passing the test does not prove Kerr*. **(C) The signal:** a near-horizon
deformation (§85 bump) shifts the ISCO more than the photon-ring observables (shadow, ringdown) — §88's
complementary sensitivity — so the three inferred spins *disagree*, and the spread GROWS with the deformation
(0 → 0.034, ISCO disagreeing most). The inconsistency IS the detection: *failing the test proves non-Kerr.*
Repro: `scripts/93_weigh_spin_three_ways.py`.

## §94 — relativistic precession & QPOs: frame-dragging you can time
A circular orbit has THREE frequencies — orbital ν_φ, radial epicyclic ν_r, vertical epicyclic ν_θ — and their
splittings are the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) seen in accreting BH X-ray binaries (the
relativistic-precession model). **(A)** ν_r → 0 at the ISCO (radial epicyclic vanishing = marginal stability) —
an independent cross-check of the ISCO via a frequency. **(B)** **periastron precession** ν_φ−ν_r is nonzero
even at a=0 (Mercury's anomaly, now strong-field). **(C)** **nodal Lense–Thirring precession** ν_φ−ν_θ is
*exactly 0* for Schwarzschild and grows monotonically with spin (0→4.5e-4 at r=8M) — the orbit plane is dragged
around, pure gravitomagnetism. **(D)** the scale: a 10 M⊙ hole has ISCO orbital frequency ≈221 Hz (the observed
kHz-QPO band) and nodal precession ~Hz (the low-frequency QPO) — so timing QPOs measures the spin and tests GR
in the strong field. Closed-form Kerr (Stella–Vietri), cross-checked against our independently-computed ISCO.
Repro: `scripts/94_precession_qpos.py`.

## §95 — strong-field lensing: from Eddington's 1919 test to the relativistic images
Light bending — the oldest GR test. **(A)** the **weak** Eddington deflection α → 4M/b as b→∞ (validated: ratio
1.030→1.013→1.003 from above, the 2nd-order term). **(B)** the **strong** deflection DIVERGES logarithmically as
b→b_c (the photon sphere): α ≈ −ā·ln(b/b_c−1)+const, fitted **ā=0.998** (Schwarzschild ā=1); a photon makes >1
full loop, producing the infinite sequence of relativistic images at the shadow edge. **(C)** the **unification**:
the strong-deflection coefficient is **ā = Ω_c/λ** — the SAME photon-ring Lyapunov λ that sets the subring
demagnification γ (§89) and the ringdown damping (§88). Verified: ā(lensing)=0.998 ≈ Ω_c/λ=1.000, and
**ā·γ = 3.135 = π**. *Lensing, imaging, and the gravitational-wave ringdown all encode one number — the light
ring's instability.* The deflection is the full integral α=2∫b dr/(r²√(1−b²f/r²))−π (turning point regularized
by w=1−t²); a numerical caveat noted at huge b (tiny difference of large numbers). Repro: `scripts/95_strong_lensing.py`.

## §96 — tidal forces: spaghettification, tidal disruption, and a survivable horizon
The tidal field is the geodesic-deviation tensor E_ij=R_{0i0j}, read straight off the engine's curvature.
**(A)** Schwarzschild (static orthonormal frame): radial **stretch E_rr=−2M/r³**, transverse **squeeze
E_θθ=+M/r³**, traceless (vacuum) — spaghettification, exact from the engine. **(B)** the horizon tidal field
**∝ 1/M²**: a 10 M⊙ hole gives ~10⁸ m/s² per metre (~10⁷ g, LETHAL), but Sgr A* (4×10⁶ M⊙) gives ~6×10⁻⁴ m/s²
(~10⁻⁴ g — you'd cross its horizon unharmed). **(C)** tidal **disruption** vs the horizon: a Sun is shredded at
r_t≈R★(M/M★)^⅓, which is *outside* the horizon (a visible TDE flare) only for M < the **Hills mass ≈1.1×10⁸
M⊙** — Sgr A* shreds stars (visible flares), M87* (6.5×10⁹) swallows them whole. **(D)** the GW signature: a black
hole's tidal **Love number k₂ = 0** (no-hair, it does not deform); a neutron star's k₂≠0, and that tidal
deformability (GW170817) is how a gravitational-wave inspiral tells a black hole from a neutron star. Repro:
`scripts/96_tidal_forces.py`.

## §97 — Zipoy-Voorhees: the no-Carter result, now on an EXACT vacuum solution
§85 showed a quadrupole-deformed Kerr loses its Carter constant, but that deformation was *phenomenological*
(a non-vacuum bump). The honest objection — "is that a real spacetime?" — is answered here on a genuine one.
The **Zipoy-Voorhees (γ-) metric** is an EXACT static vacuum solution: Schwarzschild carrying a tunable
quadrupole δ, kept exactly Einstein-vacuum for *every* δ (δ=1 IS Schwarzschild). The symbolic curvature of
this (x,y)-dependent metric swamps SymPy — **the recurring wall** — so we build it in closed form and read its
curvature **numerically**: that is how the wall is broken. **(A)** ZV is exact-vacuum for every δ — max|R_ab|
sits at the finite-difference floor (~10⁻⁶) and is **flat in δ** (non-perturbative, unlike an O(q) construction):
a real solution, not an approximation. **(B)** the §85 basis is linearly independent (no hidden identity faking
an invariant). **(C) VALIDATION** — at δ=1 the detector recovers the Carter constant: one machine-zero singular
value (**5.8×10⁻¹⁵**, gap 5×10¹¹), and the recovered vector is **(1−y²)p_y² + 16.00·1/(1−y²)** vs the exact
Carter **(1−y²)p_y² + L²·1/(1−y²)** with L²=16 — a match to <1%. **(D)** for δ≠1 there is **no** machine-zero
singular value: the smallest jumps ~9 orders of magnitude (to ~10⁻⁶–10⁻⁵) and **grows monotonically with |δ−1|**
(δ=0.8→5.7e-6, 1.2→1.6e-5, 1.4→4.1e-5) — **no conserved quadratic survives** (no Carter constant). This rules
out a quadratic Carter, *not* every integral (a higher-order Killing tensor isn't excluded by this basis); ZV's
full non-integrability is the literature's proof, which our result is *consistent with*, not a re-derivation of.
**(E)** the *same*
detector recovers Carter for Schwarzschild and finds none for any deformation, on an exact vacuum solution —
**upgrading §85 off its phenomenological bump onto a genuine spacetime**. Prior art, cited not claimed:
ZV's non-integrability and absent Carter constant are established (Lukes-Gerakopoulos, *Phys. Rev. D* **86**,
044013 (2012), [arXiv:1206.0660](https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0660); for δ=2 there are chaotic orbits). The
contribution is the *validated general detector* — it needs no closed-form Killing tensor or separability, so it
works where the symbolic route swamps. Honest caveat: our coarse bound-orbit scan saw only mild box-dim
elevation (≈1.1 vs ≈0.9 at δ=1), not the strong δ=2 chaos the literature locates via resonant islands — the
sharp signal here is the *algebraic* absence of the conserved quadratic, not the geometric chaos. **Adversarially
stress-tested** (`scripts/_zv_stresstest.py`, 5 tests, all pass — "did we break the wall or see what we wanted?"):
(1) the δ=1 control is genuinely Schwarzschild — the *textbook* Carter constant (not fitted) is conserved along
its orbits to 6.6×10⁻¹⁶; (2) **the decisive one** — δ≠1's 10⁻⁵ is a *real* non-invariant: it stays pinned (even
*rises*) as orbits go 16→24→32 and the integration step is halved, rather than collapsing toward the 10⁻¹⁵ floor
(if an invariant secretly existed, more data would have found it); (3) enriching the basis with 5 higher-order
terms neither destroys δ=1's Carter nor creates a spurious δ≠1 invariant; (4) the δ=1 invariant holds on a
*held-out* orbit (2.9×10⁻¹⁴) while δ≠1's best-fit does not (1.4×10⁻⁴) — not overfitting; (5) robust across orbit
families. The contrast is physics. **What "breaking the wall" means here, precisely:** we did *not* make SymPy's
(r,θ) curvature tractable — we went *around* it (an exact closed-form metric + finite-difference curvature),
and only for the **static** case. The rotating O(a²) modified-gravity metric (the genuine 2D-PDE prize) is still
open. Repro: `scripts/97_zipoy_voorhees_integrability.py` (metric `scripts/zipoy_voorhees.py`, detector

## §98 — no quartic Killing tensor either: closing §97's one caveat
§97 left one honest gap: "no conserved *quadratic*" rules out a rank-2 Killing tensor, not a higher-order one.
This pushes the same numerical search to **quartic** order (a rank-4 Killing tensor) and finds none either — so
the deformed Zipoy-Voorhees hole has **no conserved quantity quadratic *or* quartic in the momenta**. The
validation is sharper than §97's: the 42-term basis (auto-pruned to independence) is built to span **K²**, the
square of Schwarzschild's Carter constant, so at δ=1 the conserved set is {K, K²} and the SVD must return
**exactly two** float-precision singular values — **(B)** it does (7.5×10⁻¹⁵, 2.5×10⁻¹⁴, then a 4×10⁴ gap to
9.9×10⁻¹⁰), proving the basis really sees quartic invariants. **(C)** for δ≠1 there are **zero** float-floor
invariants (smallest SV ~10⁻¹⁰–10⁻⁹, four orders above the δ=1 floor). **(D) the rigor** — the §85
dimensional-null trap, caught and *proven*: a 42-term basis under-sampled by few orbits leaves a near-null at
~10⁻¹² that *mimics* an invariant; we show it **lifts 87× (1.1×10⁻¹²→1.0×10⁻¹⁰) when the orbit set is flooded
22→76**, so it is a sampling artifact, not a conserved quartic — while δ=1's two real invariants don't budge.
**(E)** the same detector recovers *both* of Schwarzschild's invariants (K and K²) and finds neither for any
deformation. Honest scope: this closes the quadratic+quartic question; a rank≥6 tensor isn't excluded, and ZV's
non-integrability *to all orders* remains the literature's proof (Lukes-Gerakopoulos 2012, via Morales-Ramis).

## §99 — the rotating wall: Manko–Novikov, no Carter on an EXACT ROTATING vacuum
§97/§98 settled the *static* deformed black hole. This crosses the long-standing **item-3 wall** — a *consistent,
exact* **rotating** "bumpy Kerr". The **Manko–Novikov** metric is an exact stationary-axisymmetric *vacuum*
solution with a tunable quadrupole anomaly q (q=0 is exactly Kerr). Its off-diagonal (x,y)-dependent curvature
swamps SymPy (the wall), so the metric *and* the geodesic Hamiltonian are evaluated **numerically**, sidestepping
the symbolic blow-up. **(A)** MN is *exact vacuum* for q≠0: the finite-difference Ricci **quarters as h halves**
(1.7×10⁻⁵ → 4.4×10⁻⁶ at h=10⁻³→5×10⁻⁴, ratio 3.94) — pure h² truncation of a vacuum metric, not a plateau ⇒
Ricci=0, a genuine rotating solution. **(B)** the q=0 limit reproduces **exact Kerr** (Boyer–Lindquist,
transformed) to **1.2×10⁻¹⁵** — the anchor (and the guardrail that caught my ZV transcription slip; here the
transcription was verified right). **(C) VALIDATION** — at q=0 the §97 detector recovers Kerr's Carter constant
(smallest singular value **7.5×10⁻¹¹**, gap **1.2×10⁸**; the floor is ~10⁻¹⁰ not 10⁻¹⁴ because the reduced
Hamiltonian is finite-differenced, not analytic). **(D)** for q≠0 there is **no** conserved quadratic — the
smallest SV jumps to ~**3×10⁻²** (10⁸× the q=0 floor, no gap). The Carter constant does **not** survive the
quadrupole anomaly. Stress-tested: robust across three (E,L) families, and the q=0 invariant holds **out-of-sample**
on a held-out orbit (3×10⁻¹⁰) while q≠0 has nothing — so the contrast is physics, not overfitting. **(E)** an
*exact rotating vacuum* black hole loses Carter under deformation — the rotating analog of §97, on a real solution,
crossing item-3's wall numerically. Prior art cited not claimed: MN's geodesic non-integrability is established
(Gair, Li & Mandel, *Phys. Rev. D* **77**, 024035 (2008), [arXiv:0708.0628](https://arxiv.org/abs/0708.0628);
Lukes-Gerakopoulos et al.); the contribution is the validated numeric detector + the verified exact-rotating-vacuum
testbed. Honest scope: rules out a conserved *quadratic* (Carter); the finite-difference Hamiltonian is noisier for
the deformed metric (H-drift ~10⁻⁴, still 300× below the q≠0 signal). Repro:

## §100 — EMRI radiation reaction: the GW flux + frequency map (the bridge's request B1)
Built to unblock a *sister project* (the bridge's B1 — full EMRI waveform), the way §77/§78 were produced for it.
The bridge had the geodesic frequency map in the bumpy metric but needed the orbit to **inspiral** (radiation
reaction). This delivers that, general over Kerr *and* the bumpy Manko–Novikov metric (§99) through one interface
(`emri.py`). **(A)** the **frequency map** — radial ν_r and polar ν_θ of bound geodesics by period-counting; their
ratio sweeps as the orbit shrinks (0.65→0.73 across sampled orbits), so an inspiral **crosses resonances**
(ν_r:ν_θ a low-order rational). **(B)** the **GW flux** dE/dτ, dL/dτ — the numerical-kludge mass-quadrupole flux,
**validated**: a circular orbit reproduces Peters' dE/dt=−(32/5)M³/r⁵ (ratio→1 in the weak field: 0.92 at r=40,
0.97 at r=70), and dL/dt = dE/dt/Ω_φ to 1% (the exact circular relation). Two real bugs caught and fixed en route
— the ω⁶ frequency weighting catastrophically amplified (i) interpolation noise (fixed with a physical
frequency cutoff) and (ii) spectral leakage from non-integer periods (fixed with a Hann window) — without those,
the flux was wrong by 10¹⁶ then 10²; the Peters convergence is the proof it's right now. **(C)** it works on the
**bumpy** metric (q≠0): a genuine radiation-reaction driver, not Kerr-only. **(D)** the flux drives a circular
orbit inward (dr/dt<0) and **chirps** it (Ω_φ rises 0.024→0.053 from r=12→7) — the relativistic chirp, the engine
end-to-end from metric to waveform-frequency evolution. Honest scope: a **kludge** (leading multipole), ~10–20% low
in the strong field (the known quadrupole-formula deficit) — enough for the qualitative resonance signature B1
wants, not a precision Teukolsky waveform; and the bumpy *resonant chaos* itself is cited (Gair, Li & Mandel 2008,
[arXiv:0708.0628](https://arxiv.org/abs/0708.0628)), not reproduced here (elusive to coarse probing, as for §97's
ZV). Per §99, the bumpy resonances are exactly where integrability fails — the physics behind B1's
resonance-crossing signature. Repro: `scripts/100_emri_resonance.py` (toolkit `scripts/emri.py`).

## §101 — EMRI Carter flux + a chaos-detector roundoff fix (the bridge's follow-ups)
The bridge **closed B1** with §100's flux (a self-consistent quasi-circular MN inspiral whose orbital
frequency drops −5%→−13% at each ω_r:ω_θ resonance crossing), then sent back two asks and a bug report.
All banked here, stress-tested. **(A) Ask A — the Carter flux dQ/dτ.** §100 returned only dE/dτ, dL/dτ
(so the bridge inspiral had to stay quasi-circular, Q=0); for eccentric+inclined orbits the generic
resonances need the third integral's rate. `emri.quadrupole_flux(..., carter=True)` now also returns
**dQ/dτ**. *(Refined after a second bridge round that found the first version degrading on the strong bump.)*
**Two fixes, both reproduced from the bridge's concrete failing case** (MN q=0.2, E=0.95, L=2.6, x0=8.0):
**(i) a 250× dE inflation** — traced to a spurious high-w spectral tail (the orbit sits at ν_r:ν_θ≈2:3, and
the ω⁶ weighting amplifies its non-convergent tail); fixed with a **convergence-plateau cutoff** that stops at
the physical plateau (Kerr unchanged; MN −1.6e-2 → −9.0e-5, right at Kerr's level). **(ii) dQ/dτ>0
(unphysical)** — the old Newtonian-Carter form 2(L_x dL_x+L_y dL_y) averages the precessing ⟨X×V⟩ to (0,0,L_z),
so dQ→0 with a spurious sign; replaced by the **radiation-reaction (Burke–Thorne) force** a^i=−(2/5)(d⁵I_ij/dt⁵)X^j
with Q=L_x²+L_y², which captures the precession correlation. Now **dQ/dτ=0 equatorial** (to 10⁻¹⁸), **<0 inclined**,
**monotone with inclination on Kerr *and* the bump**. Honest kludge — leading multipole, omits the relativistic
a²(1−E²)cos² piece, and for the bumpy metric Q is only an approximate third integral (§99). **(B) The bug
(a real one in our shipped code).** `geodesic_chaos.lyapunov` false-positived chaos on bumpy metrics. We
**reproduced it exactly**: on an MN q=0.5 orbit that is *regular* (box-dim→1.12), the old settings
(Christoffel step ch=1e-6, separation d0=1e-8) report **λ=0.32** — pure finite-difference roundoff (~ε/ch)
swamping the d0 separation. It's a 2-D corner artifact (needs *both* small ch *and* small d0) that collapses
to the floor when either is increased. **Fix:** de-noised defaults (ch=1e-4, d0=1e-6) → λ=0.001. **(C) The
robust detector:** the box-counting dimension (`poincare.box_dimension`) is immune (geometric, not a
divergence rate) — the verdict to trust; both detectors are validated on genuine chaos elsewhere (box-dim
on Hénon–Heiles §84=1.34, λ on the di-hole §79=2.09). **Ask B (a bound MN orbit with box-dim→2)** was *not*
found by systematic low-L scanning (max ~1.16–1.22, regular — and a borderline orbit gave a real-but-tiny
λ=0.05 where box-dim converged regular, exactly the disagreement that makes box-dim the verdict); MN's
documented chaos needs the literature's specific initial data (like §97's ZV). `emri.mn_bound_orbit` is the
launcher delivered for it. Repro: `scripts/101_emri_carter_and_chaos.py` (toolkit `scripts/emri.py`,
de-noised `scripts/geodesic_chaos.py`).

## §102 — the Manko–Novikov chart bug + asymptotic-flatness fix (found via the bridge's Ask 2)

The bridge green-lit a **rod-stable** MN reimplementation for the literature's strong-bump chaotic
orbit (χ=0.9, q=0.95), asking that the outer region stay numerically identical. Attempting it
**uncovered a real bug instead**: our shipped MN metric is **not asymptotically flat for any q≠0** —
`g_xx → 0.085×` the Minkowski value at infinity (g_tt, g_tφ, g_φφ all correctly → 1; direct test
`g_xx(q=0.2)/g_xx(q=0) = 0.0851`, not 1). **Why both our checks missed it:** the vacuum residual is
insensitive to a *constant* in γ (Ricci=0 is preserved under γ→γ+c, since γ enters only through
derivatives), and the q=0=Kerr anchor has β=0, so a wrong γ′-constant passes *both*. It was also the
high-q **overflow** cause — the spurious constant is ≈ −6β, driving e^{2γ}→0 (g_xx underflow)
everywhere as β grows (it failed even at x=2, not only near the rod).

**The fix (gauge normalization, in log space).** Subtract γ's value at infinity so e^{2γ}→1 exactly:
`loge2g_inf` computed once at x=60, then `e2g = exp(2γ′ + log(A/((x²−1)·nrm)) − loge2g_inf)`. Working
in log space is what removes the underflow, so **χ=0.9, q=0.95 becomes computable**. **q=0 (β=0) stays
byte-identical to exact Kerr** (rel ~1e-16, every component); vacuum preserved (Ricci h²→0 for q=0.2
*and* q=0.5); the g_xx ratio q=0.2/q=0 is now **1.0004**.

**Re-validation (all green).** §99 (no Carter for q≠0) **unchanged** — integrability is path-based,
hence chart-independent; §100 (Peters, q=0 Kerr) unaffected; §101 green, and the corrected chart makes
the MN q=0.2 flux dE/dτ = −6.7e-5, *even closer* to Kerr's −6.7e-5 than the pre-fix −9e-5. The fix is a
constant rescaling of g_xx, g_yy, so orbit **paths** (Poincaré sections, box-dim, integrability) are
preserved exactly; only proper-time quantities (flux, frequencies) move, and they move toward correct.
**Bridge impact (relayed):** B1's box-dims / positive-controls are unchanged; B1's flux & frequency
*values* shift (they were on the non-flat chart) → re-run on the corrected metric.

**Ask 2 — MN's own bound chaos (the intended positive control): characterized, not cleanly exhibited.**
With the metric now computable at the literature params, the permissible region at (χ=0.9, q=0.95,
E=0.95, Lz=3) splits into **three** disconnected wells (Kerr has one): an **inner** [1.24, 1.64] that
is *metric-degenerate* (g_tt, g_xx, g_yy → 0, with a signature flip to closed timelike curves by x≈1.7
— the known MN near-rod naked-singularity pathology); a **second** lens [3.04, 4.96] (bound in y by the
W=−1 wall, but its inner edge **abuts the degenerate zone** — orbits launched there drift inward to
x≈2.98 and hit the pathology); and an **outer** [5.58, 31] (clean — orbits read **regular**, box-dim
0.97–1.03). So at this *extreme* quadrupole the candidate chaotic basin is **pathology-bound**, not a
clean chaotic sea. This matches §97/§98 (Zipoy–Voorhees) and §100/§101: MN's documented chaos is
**thin-layer near resonances** (the literature detects it via the rotation number, not gross
area-filling), and §99 already supplies the rigorous statement (no quadratic Carter for q≠0). A clean
box-dim→2 orbit was **not** exhibited — the thin layers need either the exact literature initial data at
moderate q or a rotation-number sweep, and the finite-differenced Hamiltonian makes a high-resolution
section compute-prohibitive here. The **deliverable is the corrected metric** (a real correctness win
plus the q=0.95 enabler); the geometric positive-control stays an honest, well-characterized open item.

## §103 — the MN metric verified EXACT; §104 — the near-rod inner CZV cracked (bridge round 3)

The bridge built a **Laskar frequency-drift** thin-layer chaos detector (constant section-frequency for
any regular orbit including resonant islands, drifting only for chaos — validated with a ~100× margin on
Hénon–Heiles and no false-positive on Kerr's resonant island) and asked for **one set of literature ICs**
for a chaotic Manko–Novikov orbit to aim it at.

**Convention + metric, settled.** Their quadrupole q ≡ −(M₂−M₂^Kerr)/M³ is *our* q (Gair–Li–Mandel 2008,
[arXiv:0708.0628](https://arxiv.org/abs/0708.0628)); the documented chaos (Contopoulos–Lukes-Gerakopoulos–
Apostolatos, [arXiv:1108.5057](https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.5057)) is at **χ=0.9, q=0.95, E=0.95, Lz=3**, in
the **inner permissible region** (two CZV for large Lz; inner one mainly chaotic plus an island), near the
**2/3 resonance**. We **verified our metric is the exact Manko–Novikov** — a, b, A, B, C, ψ all match the
published forms line-by-line (the `−1/+1` constants in the a,b exponentials are *correct*: the `−1` cancels
Sa's ℓ=0 limit (x−y)/R→1, so a→Kerr at infinity; the γ′ asymptotic constant is exactly what §102's
normalization compensates). **So §99–§102 are on the correct spacetime** — a solid confirmation. (Chased a
ghost first: removing those a,b constants fixes the A=0 surface at x≈3 but *breaks* asymptotic flatness by
0.6% — the tell that it's wrong; that A=0 surface is a **real** MN feature at this extreme deformation.)

**The clean target the bridge's blind sweep missed.** They swept Lz=**2.8**; the 2/3 resonance at moderate
q sits at Lz=**3.0** — `a=0.9, q=0.6, E=0.95, Lz=3.0, x0≈7.7` (ν_r/ν_θ: 7.5→0.657, 8.0→0.677). Thin
outer-region layer (our box-dim grazes 1.03, de-noised λ floored) — their detector's regime.

**The inner CZV, cracked (§104).** §103 first called the near-rod inner region "needs Weyl coordinates" —
premature. It's reachable in our prolate toolkit via two numerical moves: **(1)** an adaptive step-doubling
integrator that **refines-on-exception** (halve the step and retry when a step flings the orbit into a bad
region, rather than aborting), and **(2)** a launch that **partitions a small radial-energy fraction**
(p_x≠0 — with p_x=0 the section degenerates to a cluster; too much p_x reaches the stiff deep-inner zone and
the Hamiltonian drift blows up). The sweet spot (f_r ~ 0.1–0.25 at x0 ~ 1.56–1.60) gives **trustworthy**
sections (H-drift 1e-4…1e-3) at the literature's *exact* params, with box-dim **1.20–1.22** — the borderline
thin-chaos-vs-torus regime the bridge's detector is built to settle. Two ICs handed over (reduced state
`[x,y,p_x,p_y]`): `[1.60, 0, −2.35e-4, 7.95e-4]` and `[1.56, 0, −3.5e-5, 7.3e-5]`. The **deep chaotic sea
(x<1.5)** is still beyond trustworthy integration (the stiffness defeats it) — an open frontier needing
higher precision. Repro: `scripts/_mn_adaptive_inner.py` (exploratory).

**§105 — the positive control closed.** The bridge ran its validated Laskar frequency-drift detector on the
two exported inner-CZV series and **settled the box-dim-1.2 ambiguity cleanly**: orbit_A (800 crossings)
drift **0.0000 → regular, the inner island of stability**; orbit_B (126 crossings) drift **0.980 → thin
chaos, the boundary layer** (above Hénon–Heiles' own 0.59 chaotic floor). The length-matched control is
airtight — orbit_A truncated to 126 crossings still reads 0.0000, so orbit_B's 0.98 is real, not a
short-series artifact. So **Manko–Novikov's own bound thin-layer chaos is now exhibited on the exact metric**
— the positive control open since the first MN run (§99). Box-dim couldn't call 1.20 vs 1.22 (the §101
ambiguity); the frequency-drift detector split it ~1000×. With the bridge's outer-region sweep (17 orbits at
the 2/3 resonance we located, all regular), the **full CZV picture is classified end-to-end by one validated
detector: regular outer region · inner island of stability · thin chaotic boundary layer.** The chain that
closed it: §102 (asymptotic-flatness fix) → §103 (metric verified exact) → §104 (adaptive integrator reaches
the stiff inner basin) → the bridge's detector settles the borderline. The deep chaotic sea (x<1.5) remains
the one open frontier.

**Made self-contained (gated).** Implemented the detector natively — `poincare.frequency_drift` (dominant
frequency by windowed-FFT peak + parabolic refinement, |Δf|/f between the first and second half of the
section sequence; area-blind, no FD-roundoff or resonant-island false positive) — and battery
`105_chaos_frequency_drift.py`: **(A)** Hénon–Heiles regular 0.0000 vs chaotic 1.38 (separates order/chaos);
**(B)** Kerr bound geodesic 0.0000, H-drift 2e-15 (no false positive on an integrable metric); **(C)** the
exact-MN inner-CZV split — orbit_A 0.0000 (island) vs orbit_B 0.9798 (thin chaos), length-matched control
airtight. The native detector reproduces the bridge's verdict to the digit. So the positive control is now a
**permanent, self-contained green battery** — a third validated chaos lens beside box-dimension (§84) and
the de-noised Lyapunov exponent (§79/§101), and the one that resolves exactly where they're ambiguous.

## §106 — Zipoy–Voorhees' own thin-layer chaos, exhibited (the §97/§98 caveat closed)

§97/§98 proved ZV δ≠1 non-integrable *algebraically* (no rank-2 or rank-4 Killing tensor), but the
*geometric* chaos stayed a cited-literature caveat — the δ=2 stochastic layer (Lukes-Gerakopoulos PRD 86,
044013: E=0.95, Lz=3, chaotic ρ=7.518 vs regular 7.548) is razor-thin and box-dim scans grazed it. The
frequency-drift detector (§105), being area-blind, found the layer's **full anatomy at the plunge
separatrix** (σ=1, x0 steps of 0.002): *plunge* | **layer** x0=7.545 (drift **0.0266**, 210 crossings then
**escapes**) | *island chain* 7.549–7.563 (drift ~1e-4, never escapes) | **layer** x0=7.565 (drift
**0.0132**, 184 crossings then escapes) | *circulating tori* 7.60+. Two independent layer hits on the two
edges of the island chain, each with **both** chaos signatures: progressive frequency wander
(quarter-pair drift grows 0.005→0.025→0.070 along the series) and **finite bounded lifetime** — the orbit
sticks for ~200 crossings then escapes through the separatrix, which no KAM torus ever does. H-drift 5e-12
throughout (the signal is physics, not integration error). **Honest notes:** this is transient/sticky
layer chaos — the drift *magnitude* is h-sensitive (exponential shadowing: different step = a different
realization of the same layer) but both signatures persist at h and h/2 while the island/torus controls
show neither at any h; and the layer sits at ρ≈7.48–7.50 vs the literature's quoted 7.518 (~0.5%,
units/convention nuance) — we exhibit the documented layer's existence at the documented (δ, E, Lz), not
the exact quoted coordinate. Battery `106` asserts the triple contrast (layer fires + escapes · island
quiet + survives, a **267× drift ratio 0.012 apart in x0** · torus quiet). **With §105, both exact
bumpy-BH metrics in the engine (MN rotating, ZV static) now have their algebraic non-integrability backed
by an exhibited geometric positive control** — the frequency-drift detector is 3-for-3 on thin layers.

## §107 — the devil's staircase: resonance frequency-locking (the quasi-static LISA signature)

The reason a bumpy-metric EMRI is observationally distinguishable (Lukes-Gerakopoulos/Apostolatos/
Contopoulos PRD 81, 124005): inside a resonance island the orbit's rotation number is **locked to the
rational** across the island's finite width, while integrable Kerr has no islands — resonant tori are
measure-zero, so nothing locks. Swept the section rotation number across §106's ZV δ=2 zone (E=0.95,
Lz=3, x0∈[7.50, 7.71], 0.005 steps) with the §105-validated section-sequence estimator, and the full
staircase appeared: *plunge* | *chaotic layer* (off-rational, escaping) | **1/5 lock** (x0 7.555–7.565:
ν = 0.20000, 0.20000 exact, 0.19982) | *layer* | **smooth riser** (0.2141→0.2458 over 13 monotone steps,
~0.002/step) | **1/4 lock** (x0 7.645–7.665: **five consecutive points at 0.25000** — the approach snaps
from 0.2458 onto the rational and holds) | *release* (0.2539→0.2648). The 1/4 island is fatter than the
1/5 (KAM ordering). **Instrument honesty:** two trajectory-FFT estimators were tried first and *fooled*
— by libration peaks, then by the fully commensurate spectra near locks (at a locked orbit every
spectral peak is an integer multiple of the closure frequency — itself independent confirmation of the
lock); the section-sequence frequency is the unambiguous instrument. **Kerr control (corrected):** the
first control varied r0 at fixed (E, L, p_θ), which pins the Carter constant — every point the *same*
torus (identical ν to 5 digits; a correct-but-useless control, caught and redesigned). With
turning-point launches (distinct tori): ν falls smoothly 0.26598→0.26361, monotone, never within 0.013
of a rational — the anti-staircase. Battery `107` asserts the two locks, the moving risers, and the
no-lock Kerr control. **This closes item 1a of the follow-up plan:** a bumpy spacetime *locks* crossing
orbits to rational frequency plateaus; Kerr cannot — the quasi-static half of the LISA resonance
signature, as a gated reproducible result. (Also: `scripts/_ckpt.py` — sweeps now checkpoint per-point
to durable repo-local files after another power loss; the staircase itself was already banked.)
Repro: `scripts/107_resonance_locking.py` (sweep scaffolding `scripts/_plateau_quasistatic.py`,

**Where the niche stands (own literature sweep, 2026-06-16).** Path 1 (automate
the physical-vs-gauge / SPSM criterion) is closed: xCPS (arXiv:2606.05204, open
source) already automates covariant phase space, Noether charges, and Wald
entropy from a generic Lagrangian — so don't build it. The nearest neighbour to
this engine is AInstein (arXiv:2502.13043, Oct 2025), which finds Einstein
metrics via ML but **numerically** (Euclidean, approximate). The differentiator
is therefore sharp: this engine is **exact, symbolic, and proven** — and now
spans vacuum→matter in both discovery and proof. A genuinely-new exact metric
remains the hard standing problem for everyone and is explicitly not claimed (D26).
